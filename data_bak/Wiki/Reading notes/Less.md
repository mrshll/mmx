Turns out Pulizer fiction winners are, in fact, quite good. I devoured this in just a few days. The story is one full of elation, humor and a positive spin on life's valleys. From the onset, it presents you with an itenerary for the protagonist's travels, and woosh, you're off. A perfect voyage through story.
