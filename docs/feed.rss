<p>Happy 2023! The fresh start. The clean slate. Especially for Alejandra and I, everything feels new. That's because we welcomed Meadow into our lives at the end of last year. We've both been on parental leave, and time is simultaneously whipping by and standing still.</p>

<p>The last six weeks has been entirely spent with Meadow, learning how to be parents. It has been much more of a challenge than I naively expected, especially at the start. It's already getting easier as we get to know her and become more confident.</p>

<p>I rewrote [[mmx]]'s compiler in Lua, substantially simplifying the logic by integrating some "lessons learned" and shedding extra features that added a lot of complexity.

<p>I've been playing with <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html">uxn</a>, which feels like I'm exercising my brain getting back into the stack machine mindset. One of my favorite assignments in college was building a <a href="https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40-2011f/notes.html#toc100">Universal Machine</a>. This class was formative, and it's been a joy to play again in a similar language.</p>

<p>Watching talks from Handmade Seattle set me on a short jaunt learning about [[Local-first applications]]. Okay, it's true I run a business primarily built on cloud technologies and subscription models, but these models are too often applied by default in ways that only harm users and communities. And we are exploring ways for organizations to run some of our technology (like our forecasting models) themselves on their own infrastructure. I'm excited for a resurgence of local-first applications with collaboration as a first-class consideration. <a href="https://earthstar-project.org/">Earthstar</a> is another interesting technology that could enable a new kind of user ownership.</p>

<p>I wrote two quick posts, one about [[Self-hosted Mastodon|hosting your own Mastodon instance]] and another about [[Running a basement server|running a basement server on old, forgotten hardware]].</p>

<h2>Hosting Mastodon from your basement</h2>
<p>There are plenty of great resources to help folks with a moderate technical background setup a Mastodon instance, including <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/prerequisites/">the official documentation</a>. However, I thought I would write down the steps I took in one place to set up <a href="https://werm.world">werm.world</a>, the Mastodon instance running on {zombiebox} in my basement.</p>

<p>Outline:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Setup a home server</li>
    <li>Setup Mastodon</li>
    <li>Instance configuration</li>
    <li>Ongoing maintenance and backups</li>
</ol>

<h2>1. Setup a home server</h2>

<p>You could, of course, rent a server on !the cloud!. In my case, I intended to only house a couple of folks on my instance, and so wanted to keep ongoing costs low. Plus it's an opportunity to make use of old or unused computers. Earlier this week, I wrote about {running a basement server}. </p>

<p>On my server, I am running a minimal version of Ubuntu. However, if I were to do it again (and I may perhaps migrate in the future) I would dig deeper into <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>. One of the most tedious aspects of server experimentation is remembering setup steps, minute edits to configurations hidden in the depths, and terminal commands with side-effects. What makes NixOS so exciting to me is that it solves for just this, and more. NixOS is declarative, meaning a configuration can be used for reproducable outcomes. Had I used NixOS, I could simply share the portion of the configuration for the Mastodon server, and you could merge this into your configuration and replicate exactly what I was running. However, since I just welcomed a new child to my family, I figured I would limit the number of variables, stick to what I knew, and save NixOS for a later adventure.</p>

<p>For posterity, the resources I found are:</p>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/pkgs/servers/mastodon">nixpkgs nixos repo - mastodon server</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Setup Mastodon</h2>

<p>To setup Mastodon, follow the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/prerequisites">official setup documentation</a>. Hah, gotcha! But wait, why is there so much <em>text</em> here? I will interject a few notes where either the documentation assumes experience that one might not have, or where I modified the steps.</p>

<h3>Preparing your machine</h3>

<p><em>Do not allow password-based SSH login</em></p>

<p>If you are setting things up on your server directly (i.e. you are typing commands into the device directly) you will likely want to enable remote access on your local network via <code>ssh</code>. If you aren't able to <code>ssh</code> into your machine, you may need to install <code>openssh-server</code> or the equivalent service for your operating system. On linux, you may need to also run <code>sudo ufw allow ssh</code> depending on your prior firewall configuration to enable ssh access to the server.</p>

<p>By default, when you ssh into your home server, it will prompt you to enter the password. What the setup guide suggests here is to disable this and restrict ssh access to an allowlist of authorized keys. On each of the computers you will use to manage the server over ssh, run the following to copy your ssh public key:</p>

<pre><code>~&gt; ssh-copy-id marsh@zombiebox.local
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>marsh</code> and <code>zombiebox.local</code> are replaced with the server user and hostname or ip respectively.</p>

<p><em>Install fail2ban so it blocks repeated login attempts</em> and <em>Install a firewall and only allow SSH, HTTP and HTTPS ports</em></p>

<p>I skipped these... since they are enforced by the firewall on my router. I've made sure that ssh is only possible via the local network -- meaning my router <em>only</em> forwards ports 443 and 80 to {zombiebox}. If you were running a server that was directly internet facing with it's own <em>external</em> IP (i.e. not fronted by a router/firewall), these steps would be a smart idea. If I've made a grave error, please be gentle and let me know!</p>

<h3>Installing from source</h3>

<p>This section is mostly complete, and I followed exactly. There are just a few deviations/corrections of note.</p>

<p><em>Acquiring a SSL certificate</em></p>

<p>I had to approach this step a bit differently from the guide. First, in order for <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt</a> (one the best things to happen to the internet) issue your certificate, your server needs to be reachable via the internet. Make sure you've completed the port forwarding steps in {running a basement server}. If you haven't you may get an error to this effect.</p>

<p>Additionally, the mastodon nginx configuration that they provide to copy into your server's <code>/etc/nginx/sites-available/mastodon</code> was invalid without the cert, and their recommended method, <code>certbot</code> wouldn't run because of the invalid nginx, a Catch-22 of sorts. Instead, I ran the following to create my SSL certificate:</p>

<pre><code>letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d werm.world
</code></pre>

<p>Under the root user, I added the following cronjobs (using <code>crontab -e</code>) to make sure the cert stayed up-to-date:</p>

<pre><code>0 1 * * 1 /usr/bin/letsencrypt renew &gt;&gt; /home/mastodon/letsencrypt.log
5 1 * * 1 /bin/systemctl reload nginx
</code></pre>

<p>Finishing the guide, everything worked except css and js assets were not being served. After a bit of digging, I found <a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/3584">this issue</a> and changed the permissions of the <code>mastodon</code> user's home directory per the issue.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mastodon-running.png" alt="screenshot of my instance displaying my migrated profile"/></p>

<h2>3. Instance configuration</h2>

<p>Everything was running! I created my admin user, migrated an existing account to the server, to live at <a href="https://werm.world/@mrshll">@mrshll@werm.world</a> - but the timeline was empty! This was an important detail to federation that I didn't understand before setting up the server. </p>

<p>Running and instance of uno (or a small cohort) has two main drawbacks that I've found so far:
+ a mastodon server is only aware of instances it is federated with, and only has passive information about posts that occur during its time running
+ posts by authors you follow may appear to have empty replies, whereas folks from servers you are not federated with may have replied</p>

<p>At first this seemed show-stopping. I love to see conversations "in the replies," as it's often a great way to find new viewpoints or folks to follow. I tried to solve this by setting up what are called "relays" which seem like mastodon firehoses to "pseudo-federate" your instance and receive a lot of extra content. This, however, wasn't worth the extra bandwidth, media storage, and server load so I've since disabled them all. Instead, I found that you can simply click the date of a post to view it on the author's server. There you can see the entire set of replies. Not so bad! But worth being aware of.</p>

<h2>4. Ongoing maintenance and backups</h2>

<p>Backups are important. That's a maxim made more pressing by my use of dilapidated hardware as the webserver. Usually, my method of "backup" is to use <code>scp</code> to copy important files and database dumps from my webserver across the local network to my desktop. If you want to rely on <em>the cloud</em> you could use a storage provider for extra off-site redundancy. But in the spirit of incurring no costs, keeping it all under by solar-powered roof, and using existing hardware, I'm going to keep it simple.</p>

<p>I created the following <code>backup.sh</code> script to periodically back up the important bits, including postgres, redis, and media/static files.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

NOW=$(date --iso-8601=seconds)
HOST=marshbox.local
HOST_USER=marsh
DEST_DIR=/data/zombiebox-backup/mastodon/$NOW/

if ping -c 1 -W 1 "$HOST"; then
  echo "$HOST online, backing up"

  runuser -l mastodon -c 'cd /home/mastodon &amp;&amp; mkdir backup'

  # postgres
  runuser -l mastodon -c 'cd /home/mastodon &amp;&amp; pg_dump -Fc mastodon_production -f /home/mastodon/backup/postgres.dump'

  # redis
  cp /var/lib/redis/dump.rdb /home/mastodon/backup/dump.rdb

  tar_cmds="tar -czf backup/accounts.tar.gz live/public/system/accounts/ &amp;&amp; \
  tar -czf backup/media_attachments.tar.gz live/public/system/media_attachments/ &amp;&amp; \
  tar -czf backup/site_uploads.tar.gz live/public/system/site_uploads/"

  # uploads
  runuser -l mastodon -c "cd /home/mastodon &amp;&amp; $tar_cmds"

  # ensure the destination directory and send 'er over
  ssh $HOST_USER@$HOST "mkdir -p $DEST_DIR"
  scp /home/mastodon/backup/* $HOST_USER@$HOST:$DEST_DIR

else
  echo "$HOST not online, skipping backup"
fi
</code></pre>

<p>For this file in particular, I wanted to make sure it ran, so I tried <a href="https://healthchecks.io/">healthchecks.io</a> for the first time and added the following cronjob for the root user:</p>

<pre><code>0 3 * * * /home/mastodon/backup.sh &amp;&amp; curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 5 -o /dev/null https://hc-ping.com/{UUID}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mastodon-healthcheck.png" alt="Screenshot of healthcheck.io showing my cronjob"/></p>

<p>As of now, I think that's just about everything I've done for the server. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out :)</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 


<p>A few years ago, a laptop of mine experienced inexplicable battery failure. Each time the laptop violently ceased operation when A/C power was removed, it communicated with me. "I am a homebody," it said, "and I wish to remain in the proximal comfort of the outlet." And a makeshift basement server, {zombiebox}, was born.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/zombiebox.jpg" alt="Zombiebox the home server running my the basement"/></p>

<p>With any home server, especially one exposed to the internet, there are a few challenges one must overcome:
1. Your home's <em>external</em> IP address will periodically change (unless you pay for a static IP, which I do not)
2. Your local network might change your server's <em>local</em> IP address
3. When a request is made to your home's <em>external</em> IP address, your router must know what to do with it</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: most ISPs do not allow running "servers" from a residential subscription. Their terms are vague, but proceed at your own risk.</p>

<h2>1. Dynamic DNS</h2>

<p>To solve the first issue, where your home's <em>external</em> IP addresses periodically changes, you have to continually update your DNS records to reflect the current IP. For example, when setting up a Mastodon instance on werm.world, I needed the root A record to point to the IP address of my home. There used to be a number of daemons and somewhat questionable services that I would use for this - but this time around I found that Google Domains (my registrar for werm.world) had a (new?) hidden <em>Advanced Setting</em>. You should see if your registrar supports something like this natively - at its core, all you need is a programmatic way to update a DNS record so look for an API to do so. Hopefully, you can adapt some of the following for your purposes.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/google-dyn-dns.png" alt="Screenshot of the advanced settings for Google Domains DNS"/></p>

<p>By creating a Dynamic DNS record, Google Domains provides credentials that can then be used with their API to update the IP. So, on {zombiebox}, I patched together the following script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh

HOSTNAME=""
USERNAME=""
PASSWORD=""

LOG_IP_FILE="/tmp/ddns_ip.log"
touch $LOG_IP_FILE

LOG_FILE="/tmp/ddns.log"
touch $LOG_FILE

PUBLIC_IP=$(curl -s -k https://domains.google.com/checkip)
DDNS_IP=$(echo ${LOG_IP_FILE})

if [ "$PUBLIC_IP" != "$DDNS_IP" ]; then

  URL="https://domains.google.com/nic/update?hostname=${HOSTNAME}&amp;myip=${PUBLIC_IP}"
  RESP=$(curl -s -k --user "${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}" "$URL")

  case $RESP in
    "good ${PUBLIC_IP}" | "nochg ${PUBLIC_IP}")
      echo $PUBLIC_IP &gt; ${LOG_IP_FILE}
      echo "`date`: ${HOSTNAME} successfully updated to ${PUBLIC_IP}." &gt;&gt; ${LOG_FILE}
      ;;
    "nohost")
      echo "`date`: The host ${HOSTNAME} does not exist, or does not have Dynamic DNS enabled." &gt;&gt; ${LOG_FILE}
      ;;
    "badauth")
      echo "`date`: The username / password combination is not valid for the host ${HOSTNAME}." &gt;&gt; ${LOG_FILE}
      ;;
    "notfqdn")
      echo "`date`: The supplied hostname ${HOSTNAME} is not a valid fully-qualified domain name." &gt;&gt; ${LOG_FILE}
      exit
      ;;
    "badagent")
      echo "`date`: Your Dynamic DNS client is making bad requests. Ensure the user agent is set in the request." &gt;&gt; ${LOG_FILE}
      exit
      ;;
    "abuse")
      echo "`date`: Dynamic DNS access for the hostname ${HOSTNAME} has been blocked." &gt;&gt; ${LOG_FILE}
      exit
      ;;
    "911")
      echo "`date`: An error happened on Googles end." &gt;&gt; ${LOG_FILE}
      ;;
    *)
      echo "`date`: $RESP" &gt;&gt; ${LOG_FILE}
  esac
fi
</code></pre>

<p>And I added a cronjob to run it regularly with <code>crontab -e</code>:</p>

<pre><code>*/15 * * * * ~/apps/update-google-dyndns.sh
</code></pre>

<p>That script will let Google Domains know what your IP is.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/google-dyn-dns-setup.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Domains Dynamic DNS successfully configured and running"/></p>

<p>To test without a browser you can run the following, noting the <em>ANSWER SECTION</em>:</p>

<pre><code>~&gt; dig werm.world

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.6 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; werm.world
;; global options: +cmd

</code></pre>

<h2>2 + 3: Getting requests from the internet to the basement</h2>

<p>Configuration depends on he server's operating system and the router used for the network. The crux of what is needed is threefold: 
- the server must be setup to always request the same local IP address from the router,
- the router must reserve that IP address for the server's hostname, and
- the router must be configured to forward the right requests to the server</p>

<p>If fiddling with your router is new to you, you must first find its address and log in to it's management application. For me, the router's address is 192.168.1.1, but it differs vendor to vendor. To check, you can look at your operating system's network settings for a "router" entry. Or, you can run the following while connected to the network:</p>

<pre><code>~&gt; netstat -nr | grep default
default            192.168.1.1        UGScg             en0
</code></pre>

<p>A router's management application will have username/password authentication which is either set to a vendor default or noted physically on the router.</p>

<p>Look for DNS settings, often hidden under an "Advanced" veil. There, you can set the server's hostname (in my case "zombiebox.local") to be assigned a specific <em>local</em>. With a consistent <em>local</em> IP, the router can be configured to forward requests made to your <em>external</em> IP of a certain port (i.e. 443) to the server's <em>local</em> IP. To do this, look for "Port Forwarding" and select the server's IP as well as the port (in a webserver's case, 443 and/or 80).</p>

<p>It's dependent on what you are hosting, but from there you can use something like nginx running on the server to route requests to the correct process depending on the domain/request.</p>

<p>Proper security of a home network server is beyond the scope of this humble post, but in short forward the smallest set of ports possible for your server to function on the internet, and follow any application-specific guides closely on best practices for securely running the server.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 


<p>Tonight I fixed Alejandra's favorite camera - her Dad's Ricoh Singlex TLS from the 70s. It had no shutter action and the view finder mirror was frozen in an upward position - meaning the viewfinder was blocked.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/ricoh_repair_1.jpg" alt="Ricoh Singlex TLS camera with its lens removed"/></p>

<p>I started by removing the battery but it seemed newish (these things used to run on mercury batteries and have since been replaced with equivalent voltages). From the manual the electronics were only for a light meter and optional flash, so I ruled out anything battery-related.</p>

<p>I wasn't sure where to start so I did some research and found <a href="https://simonhawketts.co.uk/2016/04/26/singlex-tls-strip-down-and-repair-part-1/">this three-part teardown and repair</a>. After a comprehensive deconstruction and refurbishment, they weren't able to find the culprit, which disheartened me slightly.</p>

<p>I removed the bottom plate to get at the shutter gear assembly and other internals. I noticed an arm that looked in a middle position, which seemed odd.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 


<p>I'm started to write this page on my 30th birthday, and am returning and revising it now on the last day of 2021. I don't think much of new years or birthdays, least of all my own. But lately, I've found myself daydreaming about the future. Maybe in part due to this feeling of emergence from the pandemic's isolation, or maybe it's something that happens to everyone at the three decade mark? Either way, my younger brother Malcolm asked me "Do you have any tips or examples for making a 5-year plan?" to which I replied "A 5 year plan of what? Business?" He was in pursuit of a 5-year personal plan, and aside from 5-year spreadsheet proformas for work, an exercise I endure with a grimace, my life has been light on "plan." But this moment (this one right <strong>snap</strong> now) does provide a fertile opportunity for introspection. I plan to share my findings with Alejandra, my brother, and some close friends to compare notes.</p>

<p>So what belongs in a 5-year plan? First, let's call it something else. To think that one can sit down and devise a "plan" for the next 5 years is total crap. In both personal and professional goals I've found that themes, applied consistently, can be more powerful than hard, quantified goals. The best we can hope for in planning at such a horizon is describing the <em>gestalt</em> of the next demi-decade. Is that too pretentious a word? Great. There are four sections that I want in my 5-year gestalt:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Relationships</em>: what I can give to others, who I want to spend time with, and how I can deepen my connections to friends and family;</li>
    <li><em>Craft</em>: finding creative work and craft that is fulfilling;</li>
    <li><em>Experiments</em>: testing stuff out, be it a personal experiment (my pal Quinault is a source of inspiration - potato starch before bed to stimulate vivid dreams, ramping up and down caffeine, sometimes over the course of a year or more, to <em>heighten</em> the experience), a professional shift (e.g. changing fields or roles, trying a different schedule), or something else entirely; and</li>
    <li><em>Place</em>: where I want to be, and what that placement means for 1, 2 and 3.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><em>* The below sections are in progress *</em></p>

<h2>Relationships</h2>

<p>Gosh, what a section to start with. Alejandra and I got married on November 5th, 2021. We'll have a party at some point once things chill out. We want to have kids in the next 5 years! My most significant relationship aside, I want to have a theme of communiqué, both written and by phone, with a broader circle than those on my current "speed dial". I currently regularly call my family and closest friends, but there are a number of folks I hope to keep close in spite of life's drift.</p>

<p>Over the last 2 years I've fallen into a stasis of social isolation, which given the circumstances, is not too outside of the norm. But as folks start to emerge from our collective cycles of reclusion, I have been slow to revise my modus operandi.</p>

<h2>Craft</h2>

<p>A lot of the daydreaming I've mentioned is meditation on what aspects of my work (both "real work" and my hobbies and [[projects]]) are most engaging and what about those aspects keep me creatively energized.</p>

<p>I suppose 5 years ago was the start of [[Upstream Tech]]. If my next 5 years can be as productive and "successful" (whatever that vague measure means), I'll be glad. I've been fortunate that the past 5 years of work have brought a variety pack of different roles and responsibilities. That miscellany has been valuable in starting to understand the kinds of work, from minutiae to big picture stuff, is most rewarding, and therefore what <em>my craft</em>, in the lifelong sense, could be.</p>

<p>Early in my career my measure for whether I was doing the right kind of work was "rate of learning." If that rate plateaued, I would adjust my work. In work now there is no shortage for new lessons, in fact the rate of learning has never been higher - all of the parts of business operations (fundraising, management, accounting, etc) that start getting interesting at a certain scale are in full swing. But optimizing for "rate of learning" isn't enough if you're learning things you are apathetic about. The challenge that lies before me is to determine how to balance:
+ rate of learning
+ the substance of the craft (cringing thinking of back office business stuff as craft but, hey I guess it is)
+ the outcome of the work (i.e. what the end product enables, its lasting impact)</p>

<p>This will be the pivotal question for me to answer this year.</p>

<p>[[upstream tech|Upstream's]] subject matter is one of personal resonance, but the technologies we build are difficult for me to find excuses to use myself. I find that when I am building something that I can use, I am more creative, have a inexhaustible energy, and derive more day-to-day satisfaction.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I'd like to learn crafts that use my hands and reduce my dependency on external systems and systems that produce waste. Sewing, gardening, carpentry and "handiness", and fermentation to name a few. I've dabbled in some of these, and would like to deepen my knowledge.</p>

<h2>Place</h2>

<p>I've found myself focusing a bit too much on future potential places to live over the past few years, which have prevented me from ::living in the moment, man::. When I lived in the city, I was obsessed with being closer to natural space and having room to grow food. Living in the liminal space between city and forest (aka <em>the suburbs</em>), I now want both a city and to live in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>But in thinking about where to go, and telling friends and family about potential spots, it's become clear that the <em>where</em> doesn't matter, it's really about the who else you could convince to be there with you. If I could redo my early 20s, I would try to make some manner of blood pact with my closest friends to live in adjacent living situations (or at least the same cities) for longer. It's amazing how quickly jobs pull a thick social web askew.</p>

<p>Luckily for me, I've proven to myself that place is not dependent on work, and work is not dependent on place. The two are decoupled, whether I'm practicing my craft alone, growing a team, or joining another. My main criteria when I'm thinking about where to live are:
+ ample natural space full of water, trees, trails, paths
+ an artistic and intellectual community (having a nearby college or university helps)
+ access to train and air travel
+ low-to-medium cost of living
+ resilient to climate-change</p>

<p>So I do foresee moving at some point in the near future, but it's really about figuring out who between family and close friends will be where and who can be convinced to be there too.</p>

<h2>Rethinking the future of work</h2>
<p><em>Work in Progress</em> is a name that has fittingly been with me for a long time. It was the name of my first radio show, during the coveted 7 to 9 PM slot on Vanderbilt's WRVU while I was in high school. It embodies a spirit of always giving something a go because hey, it's a work in progress. And it's fitting for an area of interest of mine: structures of work, collaboration, and equity.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Why is it that most organizations follow the same blueprint? I've been thinking about the bones of organizations and processes of collaboration recently and am stumped by the homogeneity that exists in the work world. For the most part, organizational power is centralized, an oligarchy comprised of the top leaders and those with the most substantial financial investments. Power, substantial power, is rarely distributed. Structure is hierarchical, resembling a military-like chain of command. Compensation is opaque, performance reviews are infrequent but pivotal, and promotions happen at a fixed-ish cadence -- often touted as meritocracy but in practice falling every one or two years. Remote work is <em>starting</em> to inject some variety, but helicopter managers <em>just can't tell what you're doing all day</em> and are eager to get folks back into the office.</p>

<p>There are of course counter-examples, and with a bit of digging it's possible to find organizations with transparent salaries and that embrace autonomy with no set working hours. But these (mostly tame) deviations from the norm are rare, often coming to our attention via a NYT piece that informs us that, woah, there's a hairbrained experiment going on over there - 4 day weeks, you'll never believe it - and we have no idea how it will play out long-term. A taste of optimism for a better work world tempered with a healthy dose of skepticism.</p>

<p>Is there more variety in organization structure and process than is immediately obvious? Are there as many schools of thought in corporate structure as there are power structures in governance? Why is it that so few deviate from the norm? Is it greed? A necessary outcome of risk involved with organizational genesis?</p>

<p>I'm going to discuss with others, find examples of organizations that challenge the norm with radical equitable structures, and examine potential structures and processes for a new age of progressive, remote, equitable organizations.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 

<p><em>An interview on webrings and shrinking the web</em></p>

<p>The webrings I've encountered have been an immense source of inspiration, social connection. At the start of 2021, I stumbled upon <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com">webring.xxiivv.com</a> and was immediately drawn in to the thematic cohesion and shared pursuit of creating decommodified digital spaces, better tools, and experimental processes for creative projects. As someone who first became interested in code via trying to set up a website, it also carried an air of nostalgia that is especially poignant on the sites that replicate the geocities vibe.</p>

<p>A friend from Nashville, Eli, was thinking about writing something about webrings and asked the following, paraphrased:</p>

<p><em>Are webrings a recreation of a more user-controlled internet where information, creation, art, etc can be shared without mediation by corporate entities?</em>
This seems to me a big component of it. I can't speak to the precise genesis of the various webrings I've encountered, but there are prevalent attitudes rejecting corporate ownership over internet presence in favor of {low tech}, right to repair, and longterm-ism. Through sites on the webring, I've discovered many other efforts to replace popular but corporate internet services with open source, federated, and/or peer-to-peer systems and technologies.</p>

<p><em>Do webrings represent something more philosophical or nostalgic for you, or anyone you know?</em>
I think there are two components to this:
+ The role of the webring
+ The philosophy of the kinds of websites you'll find on webrings</p>

<p>What webrings represent will differ participant-to-participant or visitor-to-visitor depending on past experience -- for example, how many hours they spent making a sick geocities site in the 90s. For me, my earliest memories of interacting with the internet were ones of sheer discovery and excitement. There was a universe to be traversed. Sites were both about topics (<em>welcome to my website all about vintage medium format cameras!</em>) and personal. Either way, the site was a unique representation of the creator. "Surfing" felt like walking the stacks of a library rather than a doomscroll of homogenic content. Stumbling upon a resonant site was exhilarating, and a whole browser extension, Stumble Upon, was built to try to structure the act of discovery across the vast chasms of the internet. Webrings create niche spaces that enable this kind of discovery and connection.</p>

<p>The nodes of the ring are as important as the ring itself. The websites are often thematically or philosophically aligned. One notes:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>This webring is for homepages of people who are interested in low tech, small game tools, and other forms of Web 1.0 inspired creativity. 
    https://emreed.net/LowTech_Directory.html</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What has surprised and delighted me the most is the way some members of the webring interact with others - I now have digital pen pals that I've met via the rings. One person wrote a fantastic <a href="https://melonking.net/melon.html?z=/thoughts/tech-needs-art.html">response essay</a> to one of my posts from years ago. It creates a lightweight network without the hand-holding of a intermediary. It's cool!</p>

<p>And two questions from Eli's editor:</p>

<p><em>Do webrings show up on search engines?</em>
The webrings and the sites that comprise them will show up on search engines unless they explicitly exclude themselves using methods that any website could. But in the common case, yes, they will appear on search engines. Even cooler though is that some webrings have search engines that just search the member websites of the webring. This is an incredible way to find others reading the same books and adding notes to their personal site, or to find someone working with a similar technology.</p>

<p><em>What evidence supports that it is a recent ‘trend,’ or having a resurgence? Do you think that it is, and if so, why?</em>
I know that people are becoming more conscious of their online presences being wholly owned subsidiaries of corporate interest. For those who are interested in subverting that, I think it will become more and more popular. However, the corporate entities are formidable opponents when it comes to a mere trend. I think their hooks are sharp and deep enough to prevent a wholesale migration back to web 1.0, the cozy web, the low tech internet.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 


<p>"Running is a celebration of life" Zaf Ahmed, my middle and highschool coach told us. Those words echo 18 years later on my long runs. And Zaf was right (I should tell him) - there is a purity in the physical act and mental state that together make running. I can't think of a better description than Zaf's: a celebration. I'm sure fellow runners will understand. There is quiet ecstasy lying in wait, and when it does you forget your legs, the strain, the heat and you can go forever.</p>

<p>I joined the cross country in fifth grade because of a crush (so perhaps I owe it all to Taylor Hannasch). I remember showing up at coach Zaf's office. He peered over his small, low-seated glasses at my broken down converse and told me I'd need some proper running shoes. I never was particularly good. The canonical 5k XC race is brutal. But I've stuck with it ever since that day with only a few pauses. And most recently, I've found new facets of running that have renewed my enthusiasm and enjoyment.</p>

<h2>How I run</h2>

<p>I stopped measuring my runs a few years ago. It's easy to become fixated on distance, time, and pace, especially with all the gizmos and apps that will tell you: hurry up! While some aspects of measurement were fun, it's great to know you're improving for example, I realized that too much data, especially real-time information, negatively impacted my enjoyment of running. First, I'd predetermine the distance and route I wanted to run beforehand, and second if my pace wasn't great it would feel like a "bad run."</p>

<p>Now I run without a phone, no GPS watch, nothing that will tell me my precise pace or distance. I generally pick a time window (i.e. "I'm going to run 1-2 hours, brb") and a direction and head off. From there, I listen to my legs and my breathing and adjust the route to go further or shorter, the pace to be faster or more modest. Because of this, my overall mileage has increased, my pace on average is slower, and I have a blast on almost all of my runs.</p>

<h2>Where I run</h2>

<p>2 years ago, {Alejandra} and I moved to Medford near the {The Fells}. When we did, I started mostly running on trails. Trail running is unique in that you're often going over complex or difficult terrain, which forces adjustments of pace and form and work a wider range of muscles and stabilizers than road running. I realized pain I'd get at higher mileages wasn't happening - even though it felt like I was jumping over rocks and sprinting down twisty paths. I attribute that to this frequent modulation of pace and stride.</p>

<p>Trail running also introduced me to the world of ultra-marathoning, which has exploded in popularity over the last decade. I found filmmaker Jamil Coury chronicling immense runs and checking in dozens of miles in, the air thin at high elevation, <a href="https://youtu.be/Kvjd9sEVv-k?t=1027">with an ear-to-ear smile describing how it had just started hailing and that it was so awesome man, what a blast</a>. This relentlessly positive attitude towards daunting physical challenges was infectious. It inspired me to turn runs into backyard adventures - runs {run to Salem, up the coastline to nearby towns}, {sunday marathon 2021, solo marathons through new neighborhoods}, and exploration of new trails in the forest. And while I've done a couple of organized races like the Fells Winter Ultra, I most enjoy solitary challenges.</p>

<p>The droplets fell from the un-fixable gutter with a tabla's rhythm. Two attempts prior, once by The Gutter Giants and once by handyman Jim (or John, I forget), had not been enough to quell its guttural(!) rebellion. The glowing readout from my backyard weather station informed me that this rain event was surpassing 1 full inch of rain. My two interconnected rain barrels ~on the verge of overflowing~ overflowed.</p>

<p>If you close your eyes in a rain storm like this one, a downpour but not quite a tempest, you can coerce your auditory faculties to transform the sparse white noise of the raindrops into the creaks and groans of an 18th century brigantine. In fact, if you lean into this brain trickery, you can almost start to feel the house around you ever so slightly sway.</p>

<p>Rainwater. Rain. Water. Redundant, and necessary.</p>

<h2>A year long interview run by Malcolm to better understand our mom</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>Mom,</p>
    
    <p>While it may be closer to your next birthday than it is your previous one, Marshall and I wanted to make good on a birthday idea that we had and--Marshall's fault*--failed to execute on.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, here's the idea: we're going to send you an email every week, asking you to write in response to questions and prompts. The jury is still out on whether Marshall and I read your responses, or if we tuck them away until we're all done.</p>
    
    <p>When will we be done? In one year. You get an email of this nature once every week. For a year. Hopefully our questions and prompts don't feel like homework, and allow you to reminisce, confess, reflect, and celebrate.</p>
    
    <p>So, below is your very first prompt. Try to get back to us within a week, or else you'll be doing double-duty. We may make a dedicated email address for this, but for now, you can respond to both Marshall and me.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Malcolm</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>

<h1>1. What are specific choices you made about how to raise us?</h1>
<p>I think our first big decision on how to raise you..although at the time, just Marshall..was to move to Nashville. We wanted to have a backyard to play in, sidewalks to learn to ride your bikes and be able to play with neighbors and close to stores so we wouldn't always be driving. We looked at a lot of cities and towns and decided to try Nashville.</p>

<p>Since dad and I didn't eat red meat, we naturally didn't cook it..so we raised you the same way, although when you were old enough to make your own choices and we thought you needed the extra protein when you playing sports, meat entered your diet. </p>

<p>Because my family always ate together and I have such fond memories of huge meals with all my relatives, we made a point of eating together as much as possible so we could talk and eat healthy.</p>

<p>Began at public school, MLM was the guinea pig for obvious reasons. They still had 'paddling' here..horrifying and his teacher was old and she grabbed kids arms and squeezed them, yikes.</p>

<p>I volunteered a lot and so I noticed things.  We decided to apply to USN for first grade and if Marsh didn't get in we'd wait until 5th grade..the rest is history.
I would have chosen to stay in public school as I did, but they just weren't good enough then.</p>

<p>Being with extended family was super important to us. Traveling to the Outer Banks and Jersey for Moutenot family holidays and Spring Lake and Baltimore to be with my family. Getting to know your cousins and other relatives, family traditions, familiar family foods, and having them treat you like they were their own is so wonderful.</p>

<p>Finally, we tried going to church and went to Christ The King, because it was a block away and Catholic..but it was so stuffy at the time and reminded us of the churches we went to (and didn't like), so we tried St Mary's Church where they welcomed all people and said the mass in spanish and english. But once again the message didn't really resonate with us and nobody liked waking up early on Sunday, getting dressed up and going to church..so we stopped and our spiritual tradition became being together, playing music, going for walks.</p>

<h1>2. How has your life turned out differently than you imagined it would?</h1>

<p>When I was in high school I thought I would become a lawyer or at least work for the government. As a senior I went to Washington and worked for my Congresswoman, Millicent Fenwick, one of the only female Congresswomen.</p>

<p>That led to majoring in Public Policy in college and then interning at the White House and finally getting a job after graduation working for Mayor Dutch Morial in New Orleans. Working for the city was interesting at first and then became so frustrating to get things accomplished, so much bureaucracy!</p>

<p>So after a year and a half I quit. I had kept working at the record store, Leisure Landing while at the Mayor’s Office, so continued there and started waitressing.. making a lot of money and traveling to Europe and Latin America.</p>

<p>From this I think I always imagined living in Europe and raising a family, I loved the sensibilities of Europeans.. the way they cooked and ate and everything about their way of life. I don’t think I imagined living in the south again, but I think it did remind me of Europe and a slower pace of life, different foods, music and culture.</p>

<h1>3. How did you celebrate your 21st birthday?</h1>
<p>Ha!
I had to look up the year, 1979 and then think about where I was...I was def at Tulane and then look for any photos I might have taken. And guess what?! I found some! They are attached!
It was Mardi Gras, which always fell close to my birthday. The whole city shut down for that day and usually a few days before..and def the day after, which is Ash Wednesday.</p>

<p>That year, I was going out with Matt Kuluz, of Pascagoula, Miss., who went to Loyola, just next door to Tulane. We all took Mardi Gras very seriously and dressed up and usually had a great time. So many parades and beads and then we'd try to find the Mardi Gras Indians who did their own parade. You'll see in one of the photos, Matt and Jay walking in front of the second line band...so fun.</p>

<p>Everybody was friends that day..we'd bounce around from house to house in the French Quarter..eating red beans and rice, it was tradition.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mom-21-1.jpg" alt="A photograph of my Mom during Mardi Gras with her boyfriend"/></p>

<p>The other photo is me with a mask on the back of my head and dressed both front and back...what was I thinking! With Lawler, my roommate. And a photo of Jay and Miggy, they owned the 'ghost tour' mansion we visited one time when we were all in NOLA, remember? Final photo is just my friends hanging out on the Quad...such hippies.</p>

<h1>4. What are some of your favorite sounds?</h1>
<p>- Certain sounds make me stop and listen;
- Trees rustling
- Ocean waves crashing
- Owls
- Woodpeckers
- Music that I love
- The sounds of you both breathing when asleep and laughing when you’re awake.. the sound of dad laughing too
- fire cackling
- my fam playing music, people I love playing music and music I love
- The quiet when I'm hiking</p>

<h1>5. What do you hope to be like when you are 75?</h1>
<p>I hope I'm really similar health-wise to how I am now...I hope I'm super active, not working any longer (yay), but traveling often with family (that's you guys) and friends. I would love to be a grandmother...hope that doesn't surprise either of you. I can see myself and dad being really great grandparents, just saying. Perhaps we'll a second home somewhere we can hang out and you can hang out with us or just use it. Somewhere bucolic and comfortable.</p>

<p>I want to be wiser, gentler, not in a big rush and see you guys more often..if that's ok.
xoxo</p>

<h1>6. What is one of the strangest things that has ever happened to you?</h1>
<p>I think I have a hard time separated strange from scary...but both of these things I thought of were both strange AND scary.</p>

<p>The first event was a long time ago when I drove with my French boyfriend, Felix to Mexico and Guatemala. It was around 1982 and we drove the Thing from New Orleans. From New Orleans we went through Mexico stopping in Mexico City, Tampico, Oaxaca and Acapulco and then into Guatemala. It was the time of Guatemalan civil war and I don't think we realized it, but there was a mandatory curfew of 10p and armed rebels and army all over the country. So while we were driving through the countryside, we were stopped by the rebels. They literally jumped in front of the car from their hiding spots. They demanded our passports and then starting searching our suitcases and everything in the car. They took a Mexican sword we bought (who knows why) and some other cosmetics and stuff...I didn't want to give them my passport because at the time the rebels hated the US as our government was helping the military. So Felix just gave them his French passport and we only spoke french to them. Stressful!</p>

<p>The other super strange and scary event happened about 10 years ago when I was showing house in Donelson. At the time I didn't even really know where I was..I felt like it was so far away. I was working with Rich and Eileen, who are still my clients and we were seeing a ranch house.
It felt like an older couple had lived there a long time, very sweet decorations.</p>

<p>As I looked out the window I saw a teenage girl slumped on the side of the next door house.
She had long hair and was super pale. I asked Rich if she was moving. She was in fact dead. We called the police and as it turned out, the house we were in was her grandparents home and her dad was their son. Gosh, that was terrible.</p>

<h1>7. What are your secret survival strategies?</h1>
<p>I don't know if my survival strategies are secret, prob pretty basic I think...mostly common sense stuff.
- Prioritize!!! This is an important one esp now..we get pulled in so many directions, it's so distracting  it's helpful and essential to stay focused on the task at hand...I love post its and my mole skin calendar..each night I prioritize what I need to do the next day. This not only is for work stuff, it's for life stuff too and this allows me to not rush most of the time and allows me to do only what I can and have time for
- be on time (good for not rushing)
- wash my hands after being in public areas with lots of people...as well as other times of course (ha)
- not to drink too much, I try to drink tequila at parties.., alternate drinking water...I learned this one a little later in life..It not makes me feel clear at parties and events, but I don't feel so bad the next day
- exercise as much as possible, especially first thing in the day..makes me feel good all day long
- try not to be too overbearing, judgey, condescending, superior...the judging one has always been a hard one for me. I know that I have been all three many times in my life..sorry.
- try to think of others in time of need or just be there for friends, remember birthdays, remembering old friends
- planning meals...you already know and embrace this one
- reading for pleasure...and using the library
- money relationship..luckily we've had money the past while and so it's easier to be generous with it, to you all, charities, people that help me. Good not to be too attached to money...perhaps I would have taken more risks if I wasn't worried about money before and those risks could have led to more benefits..money and otherwise later in life.
- make my lunch most days so when I'm starving and have to be somewhere, I am comforted by knowing I have my food with me! This goes for snacks too...and water.

<h1>8. What did you once hate but now like?</h1>
<p>- I somehow started liking oysters

- Mid century modern homes and furnishings, used to think it looked so dated, now it looks fresh
- Modern homes..now I love the open space, clean lines, windows
- Wallpaper
- Sweating
- Hiking alone
- Some country music, not a lot
- Priuses (ha)</p>

<h1>10. What heroic acts have you performed or witnessed?</h1>
<p>That’s a hard word, heroic. Because sometimes in the moment, it’s just the right thing to do and it’s not until afterwards you realize it was a big deal.</p>

<p>When I was in college, freshman year, there was a fire in my dorm of course in the middle of the night and we all had to get out by sliding down an inflatable slide. I thought the fireman were heroic that day.
Unbelievably I was in another fire at a friend's house when I was a junior.  I lost my grandmother's ring in that fire. The fireman, once again were heroes to battle the fire.</p>

<p>Growing up I remember many times the lifeguards saving people at Jersey shore. Usually in really rough ocean they would swim out holding a red plastic bouey and rescue someone.
Everyone would stand up on shore and applaud them as they hauled that person in.</p>

<p>For myself being a hero, I'm not sure there are huge events I can think of, but many small ones when I've given someone help. From not charging Thistle Farms a commission on a home purchase or discounting someone else's that needs the money. Making meals for someone in need.</p>

<p>Giving back through volunteering and donating are small ways I think of as acts of a different kind of heroism.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Are you ready for something cheesy? I think being a (phenomenal) mother is pretty heroic, among the things you highlighted. Also, what's up with all the fires? Too many still-lit joints left unattended?
    - Malcolm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very funny about the lit joints. Just some strange electrical fires.</p>

<h1>10. Under what conditions do you do your best work?</h1>
<p>To answer your new question,
I think my best work is done with some thoughtful planning.
For me having time alone is important and handwriting things or at least taking notes first and then editing. Whether it’s planning for a presentation or writing a letter, email or communication with someone. And then editing and checking for continuity and spelling.
Giving plenty of time to finish something is important.. that can be true for cooking or just plenty of time to getting somewhere so I don’t arrive harried and frazzled.</p>

<p>Focused, quiet in the sun</p>

<h1>11. Who outside your family has made a difference in your life?</h1>
<p>My 6th grade teacher, who’s name I can’t remember, was new to the Hartshorn Elementary. She was young and had long hair she pulled back in a pony tail. And she played guitar . She started a weekly event on Fridays called a Hootenanny.</p>

<p>We sat outside on the grass at school, while she played and we all sang..it was great, really made music fun and we were all part of it.</p>

<p>When I was a senior, I went to Washington and worked for my congresswoman, Millicent Fenwick. She was one of the few females in Congress, a former model, she smoked a pipe and was a Republican! She was a force and I admired her so much.</p>

<p>My philosophy teacher in college taught while smoking and pacing. Zen and the Art of motorcycle maintenance was a fav of mine. And her style was irreverent and so impactful. I will always think she made such an impression on me and I wanted to learn more.</p>

<p>After college I worked for Mayor Dutch Morial in New Orleans. It wasn’t really him that had such an impression on me, but his administration. I was in the minority at work and learned how to work with all races and sociology economic backgrounds.</p>

<p>Before we moved to Nashville, our Nashville friends  told us about Mark Deutchmann and he became our Realtor. He sold us our first house. Little did I know he would become my boss and mentor. I especially admire his soft spoken demeanor and how he is able to get things accomplished.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are more people... I’ll update this list in the future.</p>

<h1>12. What hobbies have been passed down in your families?</h1>
<p>- sewing, although I wasn’t very good at it
- cooking a lot
- walking
- swimming/beaching/body surfing
- crabbing!
- talking
- watching football
- Playing sports
- Gardening
- reading</p>

<h1>13. Could you tell us again about your pet ducks?</h1>
<p>I had to call Aunt Joan to confirm the facts, but here's what we know..</p>

<p>We got Quick and Quack for Easter, god knows why live farm animals were a thing back then.
I was playing on the front lawn of our house in South Orange and playing more with my duck than Joan's.
Suddenly a car screeches to a stop and it had run over Quack's bill.
The bill was hanging half off, yuck. So we first went to Aunt Florence's down the street and she sewed the bill on..temporarily..
Then Joan got home from school and we drove to the vet..she was sitting in the front, trying to hit me in the back.
She said, "she wanted to kill me"</p>

<p>Anyway, the duck was fine and a month later we let them go free in Cameron Field pond.</p>

<h1>14. As a kid, when was a time you disobeyed your parents?</h1>
<p>Ah! Just a few times!</p>

<p>But one time that I vividly remember was at our beach house, which was actually located on the lagoon, and I conspired with friends to wake up and go to the beach to see the sunrise. I’m not sure why I didn’t want to ask my parents.. so I just went. I got home hours later and they were so worried. I felt really badly about it. I’m not sure if I actually disobeyed them or just didn’t tell them the truth.</p>

<h1>15. First love?</h1>
<p>Oh goodness, that's a long time ago!</p>

<p>The person I remember most vividly was Vinnie..and I cannot remember his last name!</p>

<p>But he was certainly a character, not easily forgettable. As you know, I spent the summers at the beach and Vinnie lived there year round. He was older than I was, had a pony tail, super Italian. I have no idea why my parents let me go out with him..but he was charming. We spent a lot of time at the beach, swimming, goofing off...listened to a lot of music and hung out with his friends.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mom-vinnie.jpg" alt="Vinnie at the beach"/></p>

<p>I wonder what happened to him, photo attached :)</p>

<h1>16. Did you take any trips with friends when you were younger?</h1>
<p>Yes, all the time!
I remember a few vividly..one to Florida for spring break while I was in high school.
It was spring break, classic...and I combined girlfriends from the shore with a friend I met while interning in DC, who was from Cambridge.
We drove her Volvo station wagon from NJ.
It was great fun until it broke down right outside of Ft Lauderdale, our destination.
Remember, this was 1976 and there were not many, if any, Volvos around and it took the service place the entire week to fix it.
But we had a great time without car...many sunburns and frolicking on the beach.
See photo of my friend from MA and other friend from the Jersey shore.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mom-trip-1.jpg" alt="&quot;My friend from MA and other friend from the Jersey shore&quot;"/></p>

<p>Another trip was while I was in college and travelled with my friend Bridgett to France.
She was french and we stayed with her friends at first and I really learned to speak french well because they did not speak english.
We drove with them through Italy and then to her family home outside of Geneva.
It was a super rustic house in the countryside.</p>

<p>We stayed with her friends in Toulouse where we worked at a bar for a few nights and made some extra money and in the Alps, where we went wind surfing.
In one town with stayed with her friends that sold goods at the famers market, so we helped them one weekend.
We was a pretty great trip..I was gone a long while. So fun staying with friends all over.</p>

<p>Attached is a photo of Bridgett and me when dad and went to NOLA on vacation years later</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mom-trip-2.jpg" alt="&quot;A photo of Bridgett and me when dad and went to NOLA on vacation years later&quot;"/></p>

<h1>17. Is there an article of clothing that has stayed with you for most of your life?</h1>
<p>One piece that I rarely wear, but have trouble getting rid of is my agnes B sweater that I bought in Paris around 1980. It was my first time there and I went with my friend, Brigitte, who is French.</p>

<p>I was so enamored by everything french and anges B was the epitome of young french fashion and the sweater was and still is very iconic. It looks pretty much the same now as it did then..although a bit more expensive.</p>

<h1>18. What was the moment you decided you wanted to have kids?</h1>
<p>Kids!
Dad and I attended this pre-marriage Catholic thingy that we were required to do if we wanted to get married in a church. And we did, since we wanted Uncle Lee to marry us. As usual, I was very skeptical, but honestly it was really good to ask each questions about what we wanted in a marriage and if we wanted children..and we both did.</p>

<p>We waited for 5 years after we got married to have Marshall...dad was traveling a lot to Japan and Brazil and all over, so we were able to get traveling in before having children..</p>

<p>xox</p>

<h1>19. What was your favorite place you've ever lived besides Nashville?</h1>
<p>I think my favorite place was New Orleans..so magical and unlike anywhere else.
Im not sure I even visited before I started college, that was normal back then.
But I knew I wanted to be close to water, in a city and I loved the character of the buildings.
I loved the idea of being in the South after boing raised in the North</p>

<p>During college there was so much music to see..and the the old places were the best.
And the established restaurants were great.
People loved coming to visit.</p>

<p>And unlike most other cities, there were festivals galore..Mardi Gras, Jazz Fest, Shrimp Festival and on and on.</p>

<p>When you came to New Orleans it was like a step back in time and I loved that.</p>

<h1>20. Did you do drugz in college?</h1>
<p>Ha, always a great question..!?
Well, as you know I went to school in New Orleans, where they have 'go cups' for alcohol, celebrate Mardi Gras a festival known really for debauchery, Jazz Fest which combines music and partying and any other type of festival they can think of.</p>

<p>And it was the 1970's, the age of Aquarius.</p>

<p>That said we smoked pot on the quad, nobody seemed to care, did local mushrooms in the fields of Lafayette LA  and maybe something exotic like hashish when it was around.
Mostly we drank...I worked at the Mushroom as you may recall..the head shop/record store and below was our college bar, The Boot.. I drank my fair share of
White Russians, which I'll never drink again, what was I thinking!</p>

<p>Since we really didn't have a lot of money to spend on drugs..that was pretty much my extent of usage.</p>

<p>Thanks for asking!!💛</p>

<h1>21. What is your favorite thing about music?</h1>
<p>Music is a balm, it soothes, invigorates, brings people together or keeps you company when you’re alone.</p>

<p>It makes memories and evokes them. I’ve always loved music and that’s why I worked in record stores, had radio shows, became a recording engineer and part of why I married dad.
Music is so creative, culturally unique. It tells stories about certain generations, places, ethnicities.</p>

<p>It’s a mood enhancer, changer, creator.</p>

<p>Some people are able to capture your thoughts  with their lyrics.</p>

<p>My musical tastes have changed over the years. I still love reggae and african music as you know, but so many styles appeal to me
depending on where I am, what I'm doing and who I'm with.</p>

<p>I hope they keep expanding.</p>

<h1>22. What is a theory you have that you think isn't on other people's minds?</h1>
<p>This might be a tough one for everyone to agree on, but I think I’ve always thought that we are what we eat.  When people wonder why their kids are so
hyper or sick or restless, I wonder how well they eat.</p>

<p>I’m never opposed to having the occasional fast food, fries or hot dog.. but I do think it’s really important to eat a balanced diet especially for children. Then, like you guys it stays with you for life!</p>

<h1>23. What was the first dish you cooked that was "yours"?</h1>
<p>This is a hard one for me to remember. If I go way back to when I began cooking for myself it would be when my college roommate, Kitty and I had moved into a big apt. on Claiborne Ave in New Orleans. Kitty and I both liked to cook and didn't have the money to eat out all the time, so we made all kinds of food. The one dish that we really loved was barbecue spareribs, can you believe it?! We made this delicious barbecue sauce and roasted the spareribs...so delicious. Although there's no way I would eat them now, at the time they were a delicacy for us.</p>

<h1>24. What was your first impression of Dad?</h1>
<p>Dad was a really hard worker (like he is now) and looked slightly malnourished... from working long long hours. He was very New Jersey in his speech and mannerisms which was very familiar to me and he was very sweet. Most impressive is that he know so much about audio engineering and music and he was so passionate about it all. Those are my first impressions and they flourishes from there!</p>

<h1>25. What qualities/behaviors did you inherit from your parents?</h1>
<p>I think about this at times, some traits I’m grateful for, some I try to resist and change. I would love to ask you two this question as well.</p>

<ul>
    <li>stubborn, obstinate</li>
    <li>frugal</li>
    <li>kind</li>
    <li>cooking and eating</li>
    <li>socializing</li>
    <li>traditions</li>
    <li>love of family and heritage</li>
    <li>importance of education</li>
    <li>lots of questions (ha!)</li>
    <li>keeping in touch, relationships</li>
    <li>neatness.. mostly</li>
    <li>love of the sea</li>
    <li>working hard</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I’ll think of more in the future.</p>

<h1>26. Were there any shops or restaurants in Hoboken you had an interesting relationship with?</h1>
<p>We loved the Hoboken shops, especially:
- Giovanni Shoe Repair on our corner where Marshall used to walk to, usually playing his drum, which was attached to his chest.. we’d sit him on the counter and he’d play while they repaired shoes
- Sal's .. delicious pizza and fresh mozzarella
- Korean Grocery on the corner, our go to for anything we needed and snacks for Marsh.
- Stephen's College was at the top of the hill and we would play there, beautiful,  small campus
- Maxwell's where Yo La Tengo and many others played, great club
- La Isla, our Cuban coffee shop, we often got cafe con leches on the way to the Path trains and ate there when we had time</p>

<p>And our wonderful neighbors:
- Celia and her family on one side, the sweetest
- Robin and Clifford on the other side, Clifford is an artist, curmudgeon. They had a child after we moved.. we hung out often
- Lisa, Kika and Zoe, across the street. Love love them.
- Isabelle, Matthew and Steve, lived a few blocks away</p>

<p>Marshall's pre school, up the block.. Marsh went with Matthew. Very cute.. I think Marsh went just a few days a week and not very long before we moved to Nashville</p>

<h1>27. Do you believe things used to be better than they are now?</h1>
<p>I think certain things are better now:
- being able to communicate so easily
- travelling is much easier to figure and find places to stay using Air B and B, etc..
- finding products to use and get delivered so quickly and easily</p>

<p>But of course some things were better before, like not being able to find a person easily...being able to get lost and figuring it out.
Here in Nashville, I was struck by how green it was, how big the lots were and the small houses were so nice. That's changed for the worse.
Social media is obviously great and terrible. I was just taking to Lindsey and she has embraced the 'no screen time' for Julian..how he can play on his own, be more resourceful,
figure things out by himself. But at the same time, it's great for me to see what people are up to, what's happening in the neighborhood and see social events so easily.
As I said, all this can be great and terrible.</p>

<p>Many things were much simpler before, perhaps because our world was much smaller. Now we have so many more options, which makes it complicated, but could be incredible as well. All said, I think it's how we use all the new technologies and innovations that matters...for me, it's the best to incorporate the simpler traditions we love into today's crazy world.</p>

<h1>28. Have you ever had weird sleep schedules?</h1>
<p>I think three times in my life did I have weird sleep times:
- working as a waitress in New Orleans, we began work around 4p, setting up the tables, learning the specials, having the employee meal. So we actually began seating customers around 5p. And then we were busy until around 10 or 11p. By then we were hungry again and certainly not ready to go home and go to sleep. So we usually went out in a group, usually to the Columns Hotel and had something to eat and a drink. By then it was around 1am...so, I slept late on the mornings after I worked, putzed around the house during the day, hung out with friends, contemplated what to do next..I did this for about 6 months and it's where I met Laurie Smith!
- working at Skyline was insane, never knowing how long a session would go. Sometimes I call dad moaning that the session would never end. Many nights I was walking through Herald Square after midnight and there were rats running everywhere as I ran to the Path train. And then I would have sit and wait for the train to come. Once again, I would either go to bed really late and sleep late or might even need to wake up early and so completely tired the next day. many times just sleeping on my day off was all I wanted to do.
- after having you guys both of our sleep schedules were wacky depending on your sleep schedules...but you know all about baby's and their needs, right?
All worth it!!</p>

<p>xox</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>There's such an ease to your reminiscence. I can see you doing everything, especially putzing around. I feel like that time must have felt really valuable to you--do you think that it did in the moment, or was it stressful to be working part time? It feels like if someone with a college degree were to make that decision, they'd be making a sacrifice, or squandering an opportunity... Makes me think of this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0sCNzc0bRiisT7ZXS2PjBW?si=2VORBvCYR3GG_y9pc1_llA">podcast</a>
    - Malcolm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By the time I started working at the restaurant, I had already worked for a year and a half at the Mayor's office in NOLA. I realized I wasn't happy working 9a-5 and working at the restaurants got me out of that and I was able to travel..which I did for about a year. That helped me re-boot and go on to what was next. Plus, I was making more waiting on tables than I did working full time!</p>

<h1>29. What are some things that scare you?</h1>
<p>- Of course thinking about sickness and death scare me..not necessarily mine, but others that I love.
- Bees getting too close, spiders too
- Some sushi and other foods with weird textures
- Speedy cars, when I'm in them
- Heights...like when we climbed Bee Hive...that was scary and exhilarating!
- Scary movies..I guess that's the point
- Retirement...although not really scared, but I just wonder what I'll do with my time..probably anxious is a better word. But always hopeful I'll be able to spend more time doing the things I love...including hanging out with you guys.
- Certain noises in the night when dad's not here
- Running out of food..not really..but I do tend to overbuy even when there isn't a pandemic.</p>

<p>I know I'll think of more things over time..but I think I have a pretty simple list.</p>

<h1>30. What cheers you up when you start to get down?</h1>
<p>What cheers me up?
- nature...walking in nature, swimming in a lake, seeing a waterfall, swimming anywhere actually.
- reading a good book
- doing a crossword..usually a mini
- declutterimg
- home improvements
- reaching out to an old friend..or probably any friend
- yoga...hiking, barre class, really exercise in general
- calling you guys...seeing you guys...thinking about you guys
- making dinner
- eating out
- listening to a good podcast
- ping pong
- watching a cooking show
- NY Times cooking app
- a beautiful spring or fall or winter or summer day
- riding my moped
- listening to my mom sing happy birthday to me on a vm I’ve saved
- calling my sisters</p>

<h1>31. How would you go about describing the Moutenot family?</h1>
<p>My impression of the Moutenot family hasn’t really changed since I first met them. It really was one of the best things about dad. Such a big happy family, always sharing stories of when they were younger, great gatherings and always being there for each other.</p>

<p>I hope you guys remember going to the Outerbanks NC to visit them.. summer and a few Christmas’s as well. We’d all cook, play games, have a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Charlie was def the head of the family..somewhat similar to my dad, but much more fun loving.. my dad was pretty serious (like me)??</p>

<p>Diane is so thoughtful, always remembering birthdays, an avid reader and teacher.</p>

<p>Chris is like Charlie, life of the party, very fun loving and happy.</p>

<p>Joan was more reserved, but pretty sarcastic.</p>

<p>Anne and Michelle always seemed concerned about their lives..more serious.</p>

<p>Lee was the spiritual leader, calm and a listener..always there for everyone.</p>

<p>Dad, the youngest, somewhat forgotten growing up, it allowed him to be creative while they weren’t paying close attention.</p>

<h1>32. How would you describe yourself?</h1>
<p>How to describe myself and my family?</p>

<p>I probably couldn't describe myself without also describing my family.. My family is a family of men. We all love food, music, books, games, being outside. We enjoy being together. Succeeding in our endeavors is important whether it's careers or creative. Supporting each other is part of our lives and we love helping each other and watching each other flourish.</p>

<p>What's best is really a list. Things about myself:
- Mother
- Cook/Food Lover
- Swimmer/Water lover
- Sister
- Daughter
- Italian
- Realtor
- Connector
- Friendly/Sometimes not so friendly
- Sarcastic
- Skeptic
- Democrat
- Hiker
- Nature lover
- Dog lover
- Yogi
- Healthy
- Inquisitive
- Traveller
- Art, fashion and design enthusiast
- Pottery, Linocut and Photography student
- French Speaker
- Competitive
- Good friend
- Volunteer</p>

<h1>33. What's your most prized possession?</h1>
<p>When I think of possessions I think of a house, car, watch, leather jacket. And I have those things, but they are all replaceable I think. So when I think 'prized possession' I think of items I can't replace very easily or at all. I have a couple things I prize:
- my parent's Japanese gold leaf table and white couch and the ceramics
- my photographs and photo books
- the artwork you guys have made over the years
- letters from you
- art that evokes memories of a person, time and place</p>

<p>I'm sure I'll think of more things...stay tuned. xox</p>

<h1>34. What is your favorite daily treat?</h1>
<p>All morning treats..
- French roast with half and half and a tiny bit of sugar.. all bad for me.. just have 1-1 1/2 cups a day.
- Also, a hike is a treat, especially the 5 mile trail while listening to podcasts
- Crossword, the mini of course and reading the NY Times</p>

<p>Pretty simple pleasures, right?!</p>

<h1>35. Did any part of you secretly (or not secretly) hope to have a boy or a girl?</h1>
<p>The first time I was pregnant it was just about having a healthy baby. Then the second time, I think that I was split on what gender I desired. I thought a girl could be my mini me through life and dad would have Marshall.. But then I thought I really liked boys and sports and Marshall was such a sweet boy and I was always the tom boy growing up, playing outside, not into makeup.</p>

<p>I didn't daydream very long on any of that because we found out the sex because some people would ask Marsh, "would you like a brother or sister" and didn’t want for him to think he had a choice!
Then once we knew we were having a boy, we imagined the two of you being buddies and playing together.. and look at how that turned out...best buddies for life.</p>

<h1>36. Did you always want two children?</h1>
<p>Did we always want two children?</p>

<p>I'm not sure we ever said definitively ...but honestly Marshall was such a doll we thought if we had another child just like him it would be wonderful. You were a little bit of cry baby when you were little..but got through that phase. Marshall was so patient and kind to you. You two are very different in some ways and similar in others, that's the beauty of having more than one child.</p>

<h1>37. Who is your closest friend in the world?</h1>
<p>Closest friend is such a hard for me.</p>

<p>I've had a few over the years, people I can not see for a long and when we do, we just pick up where we left off. Here are the top:
- Karin..we've known each other since we moved here and have raised our kids together and travelled all over. I know if I ever need anything she'd be there
- Laurie..who I've known since New Orleans, she was my only bridesmaid and we can pick up where we leave off
- Isabelle...same for her, I may not see her, but we will always be friends</p>

<h1>38. How did dad propose to you?</h1>
<p>That is a good question and I asked dad to refresh my memory!</p>

<p>I was living in Hoboken on Adams Street with Laurie Smith. Dad came over On his motorcycle one night and without fanfare, just asked me..he said he doesn’t remember getting down on a knee, nor did he actually have ring yet, I think we used a makeshift band at the time.</p>

<p>I said yes! I think we both cried a little and we were very happy.</p>

<h1>39. What was your wedding like?</h1>
<p>Our wedding was really really fun! It was the 80's!!</p>

<p>When we first planned the wedding, we always wanted to get married at the beach, since we both love it so much. We also wanted to have Lee perform the wedding, of course and found out to have him, we had to get married in a church. So we chose a small, sweet church in Avon By The Sea..close to Spring Lake and had the invitations printed. But before we could mail them, the church burned down. A bad omen? Not sure...but we picked the church in Spring Lake.</p>

<p>The ceremony was a mass and the reception was held at the Warren Hotel, a block from the beach..I think we've pointed it out to you over the years..sadly,it's gone now. We invited everyone we worked with at Skyline and a bunch of musicians and friends, cousins, aunts and uncles. Dave Young was dad's best man and Laurie Smith was mine. The band was made up of great musicians and they were so much fun. During the night various friends got up and performed as well.</p>

<p>We hired the photographer  who Laurie assisted in NYC and he was crazy, using a large format camera to get everyone in one photo and then he flirted with my friend Lawler all night...it was hysterical. It was fun and raucous..just like you'd want at a wedding.</p>

<p>I spent so much time deciding on the food and wine..but at the end it didn't matter..it was all about the people and music</p>

<h1>40. Best vacation? / 41. Most challenging vacation</h1>
<p>Dad and I discussed this and I've had a few best vacations. Our RV trip up and down the California coast, so fun to experience the beautiful parks and sights of California. We went to such wonderful towns. I hope you remember a little bit of that trip.</p>

<p>Dad and my trip to Brazil. He was recording Caetano Veloso in Rio de Janeiro and I flew after he had been there a week or so. We got to spend with Caetano and his family, eating at their home and then following them to Bahia where carnival was starting. Dad and I stayed in a converted convent..so beautiful. Went to carnival marches and parades..saw Olodum where 100 drummers were all dressed as Gandhi. It was a memorable, incredible time</p>

<p>My trip to France, Italy, Switzerland when I graduated college. I went with my french friend, Briggitte. Hung out with her friends and learned french since most of them hardly spoke english. No agenda, no time limits. We stayed with friends in the south and helped them get ready for the market where they sold ceramics..then stayed with friends in Switzerland and wind surfed..</p>

<p>Our trip to Berlin and Norway. Especially the Norway part. Staying with Knut and his family was so wonderful. Swimming in the fjord, eating at 11pm. Getting to know their friends. And of course in Berlin, spending time with Dave. There were many other great trips we've taken..Islamorada, Isla Mujeres, Jamaica, our trip France, even the week rental for Mal's graduation with all of us, Chris and Diane...and on and on AND I hope there will be many more.</p>

<p>Most challenging vacation I think was Iceland. Many reasons...but maybe the biggest was that I tried to overplan and by hiring the guide, that was too much. Then the weather was really a challenge...tough. The price of everything was rather shocking. Somewhat stressful, but still  a lot of wonderful moments. That's all I'll say about that one!!</p>

<h1>42. How would you describe our family's relationship with our relatives?</h1>
<p>I think our family’s relationship with our relatives has changed over the years.</p>

<p>When you guys were little, we really made an effort to visit and vacation with our relatives.
North Carolina Outerbanks for Dad's family and the Jersey Shore for mine..Baltimore and North Jersey for Thanksgiving and Christmas. But now you've grown, have girlfriends and want to spend time with their families...or just come here...that part has evolved. I love that Aunt Diane, Lee and Chris and Joan came to various graduations of you both..and hope we have more happy events that will bring our families together.</p>

<p>I think we really love our relatives and love spending time with them..it's so familiar and comforting. I think the pandemic has also altered some perceptions and desires to spend more time with family as time can be fleeting.</p>

<p>It's more challenging living farther away from relatives..but we have to continue to make an effort to stay in touch and visit when we can.</p>

<h1>43. What's your earliest political memory?</h1>
<p>In 1970 when I was in Junior High (we didn't call it Middle School)
My mom and I went to Manhattan for some reason and it happened to be the first Earth Day.
We were just swept up into the march which was on 5th Ave, the most iconic street in NY.
It was exhilarating and very purposeful. 20 million Americans marched that day
This march led to the creation of the EPA.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mom-earthday.jpg" alt="My mom sitting in the trunk of a car with two of her fellow newspaper editors during Earthday parade in NYC"/></p>

<p>Perhaps this was partly why I became an editor for my high school newspaper, interned for my Congresswoman, Millicent Fenwick..etc etc..</p>

<h1>44. How do you define success?</h1>
<p>I would like to see all our relatives more. I’m going to work on that.
And I encourage you guys to visit them when you can.
I do continue to send books at Christmas, like Aunt Diane did, in a small way it helps to remain connected.</p>

<p>Success has changed for me over the years.
At first it was graduating from college and getting a job in my field. Then I realized I wasn’t happy in an office Working 9-5 and needed success in my personal life, which at the time meant the ability to travel, see the world and how other people lived because that was interesting and unknown to me.</p>

<p>Success to me, became to be happy.
Success is also having raised two independent children who care deeply about family and others.</p>

<p>Of course there is job success and that comes for me not only with making money that has allowed us to give you both a good education, but the connections and satisfaction of helping people, in making a difference.</p>

<p>Yet success continues to evolve for me. Being able to know when to stop working too hard or at all, will be the next challenge of success. Remaining in a fun, vibrant relationship with dad is also a measure of success.</p>

<p>Right now there is a little fear of making less or no money or lack of connection or finding new things to fill my time. Success will be to navigate those worries. But the pandemic shines a light on what is important and when everything is stripped away, I do feel successful inside...in work, family, community..I continue to strive for all these things to thrive.</p>

<h1>45. Are you spiritual?</h1>
<p>When you guys were little we went to church downtown where the priest encouraged inclusiveness and he said the mass in english and spanish. We want a few months,
but we all found it hard to get up and go each Sunday..it was just not compelling enough.
So we changed our strategy and went for hikes or just played on Sunday mornings, that was our form of church</p>

<p>I think my definition of spirituality is believing in the power of nature, yoga, natural healing methods (arnica, anyone?). I usually believe in karma and doing good for others. I think I believe in a higher power, but not necessarily a traditional God. If I mediate it's usually to calm my mind or clear my mind, not really to pray. But if someone I know gets hurt or needs help...I will pray to 'the gods' for them. I don't think this makes me really spiritual..but perhaps there's still time?!!
xox</p>

<h1>47. Is there a Moutenot family myth?*</h1>
<p>Dad's family remembers an event that happened in Edgewater NJ..His Nana said a big storm came in with a lot of lighting and it struck the house and a fireball flew
through the house down the hall and out the back window and came within inches of Nana..while not destroying anything.</p>

<p>I had something happen to me when I was younger... I was in a boat in our lagoon at the Jersey Shore and the engine died.  So we edged over to the bulkhead under the dock to push the boat along and I grabbed onto a wire...the wire was live and I literally felt the current run through me. Margie grabbed me and I let go of the wire. Did I almost die...that's what my pal Margie told everyone when we got out of the boat...not sure if I did or if that was a myth.</p>

<h1>48. What's the first thing that comes to mind when you think of comfort food?</h1>
<p>I know we've spoken about our house in Chadwick before..here are a couple of photos of our infamous deck! And as a bonus, the first one is of my best friend, Margie who had the boat we always went out on...she was a fearless captain...Maureen's first husband Terry is with us.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mom-chadwick.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>And then my parents sitting on the deck eating lunch, so cute. We always had a wonderful time there.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/mom-parents.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Thank you for this week's question...very easy to answer.
Comfort food for me could be an italian meal, like my mother made..lasagna, chicken cacciatore, macaroni pie, spaghetti. And it could be a roast chicken with veggies. A homemade soup is a comfort food. Also eating tacos esp at Mas Tacos is so comforting to me.</p>

<p>Honestly, homemade food made with love is truly comfort food.</p>

<h1>49. The people have decided Biden is uninspiring--you've been elected president. What is the single most important piece of legislation that you get passed? Try to be specific!</h1>

<p>For me it would be gun control legislation.
Although there are sooo many issues to chose from, reversal and new climate laws, abortion legislation,...But requiring background checks with longer vetting times, outlawing automatic firearms, creating effective buyback programs, educational programs in schools, no silencers, eliminate right to carry laws. Gun legislation could start protecting young children from senseless violence in schools, at their own homes and neighborhoods, perhaps decrease police shootings of innocent people and countless other gun related tragedies. I think the only way to slow down gun violence is to make it harder to get guns.</p>

<h1>50. What do you think about the Coronavirus? How is it affecting you? What do you think it's doing to society? How does this compare to the other historical moments in your lifetime?</h1>

<p>There’s never been anything like it in my lifetime. And it is such a mystery to everyone..when has the same event affected everyone in the world and for so long?
Corona virus has made being out in the world a scary place, torn society apart and somehow also brought parts of it together. The lack of consistency and beliefs on not only overcoming it, but in the virus itself has divided us.</p>

<p>For me, at first it was a time of quiet reflection,doing things I suddenly had time for, thinking of people I've lost touch with. I really did re-establish contact with my friend Lawler, which is wonderful. Also speaking more to my sisters, especially while pursuing the Italian roots and visa. Re-thinking home and making it more comfortable while we spend more time here and have more people over, outside of course..has brought me joy. The garden and pool and screen porch all make it wonderful to be here since we’re not traveling.</p>

<p>I bought things like a.pizza oven, different  foods to prepare, new hiking shoes.
Giving to causes that need help also brings me joy, like the Equity Alliance, small makers, struggling businesses.., candidates, local companies and candidates.</p>

<p>As I said, the virus is bringing people together in different ways, in an effort to overcome it  but also tearing people apart because of differing views on prevention, treatment and a path forward and how to help. Everyone says life will never be the same after we find a vaccine, I suppose that's true, for me I still want to travel to all the places I’ve always wanted, have a place closer to you two, visit people I’ve been missing. Also believe that every moment matters and we shouldn't take anything for granted, feel lucky we're alive and thriving, able to help others and continue to support each other.</p>

<h1>51. Is there anything you wish we asked you about?</h1>

<p>I think it’s ok to talk about any regrets I have.
Perhaps regrets don’t have to be bad things we didn’t do, but learning tools for life.
So with that in mind, here are some thinks I’ve contemplated over the years.
- Dad and I should have bought more property in Wedgewood Houston when it was undiscovered and so cheap!
- I think this goes back to my father, the CPA, always being so cautious about spending and saving, never letting a gas tank go below a quarter of a tank, never wasting food...but always spending money on our education and buying us what we asked for, within reason...usually. So, I always had my dad' voice in the back of my head...save, save save....don't take risks. But I regret not risking more on real estate or not travelling more over the years. spending money on some things I wanted, I need to make up for that. And being more spontaneous, I tended and still tend to be too cautious at times..I need more spotaneity in my life.</p>

<p>Also, I could tell you about the things I want to still improve on
- my yoga skills..especially handstand and shoulder stand
- cooking, especially pizza making
- hard, long hiking
- keeping in touch with old friends, making time to visit them
- not being so judgemental and critical of people, that's a tough one for me...I have to continue to remind myself that everyone's different and look at things from their prospectives
- not worrying about money too much, see regrest above..and ask, 'does it bring me happiness', at least most of the time</p>

<h1>52. What did you learn from these questions?</h1>

<blockquote>
    <p>Here's your fifty-second question. Oh, and Happy Thanksgiving too. I'm grateful you were willing to embark on this project with Marshall and me. I'm grateful to have learned so much about you and to have affirmed the things we already knew (or suspected) and love most about you. Thank you--we love you.</p>
    
    <p>Before I ask question #52, I just wanted to share a few more things...</p>
    
    <p>With virtually every response we received from you, I recognized a gamely-ness. That is to say, you really wrote. I think that's so cool and I hope you find other, serious (insofar as they feel serious to you) outlets for what seems to be an entire circus tent of words dying to get out of your head, onto the page.</p>
    
    <p>There really was a lot that I didn't know about you. It makes me think that you and dad could spend a good deal more time subjecting Marshall and me to your memories. Without grandparents, who I know do this sort of thing at virtually any opportunity, I think that responsibility falls on your shoulders... That is until you become grandparents yourself. But I don't want to wait that long. More memories, more stories. You may even be surprised by what you remember.</p>
    
    <p>I could probably go on, but here's my incredibly simple, if not anticlimactic, final question for you. Thanks again--this was an incredible gift for Marshall and Me.
    - Malcolm</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, thank you both for taking the time to ask me questions and be curious about my answers.
It seems that there isn't always enough time to talk about our past..the questions allowed me the time..and time to think about my answer..usually while walking.
I think that the fact we live far from one another makes it even more important to talk, communicate any way we can, thank you for giving me this opportunity</p>

<p>From writing my answers, it brought up memories of my past, mostly fond and precious. I think that's why I enjoy taking photographs so much, to keep these memories alive.
Some questions went beyond just remembering, but being honest about more personal questions or about my past..that's always a good, right?
The questions also made me pretty melancholy at times, remembering my parents, growing up, old friends and lives.
Perhaps about pivotal moments of my life, decisions I made and how they affected me.
Also, it continues to remind me how you both are not children anymore..which brings tears to my eyes when I think how quickly life goes by and how I cherish the memories we have,
I think you're right about wanting to tell stories of our past to our children and then grandchildren...it's important to learn about the past and where we and our ancestors come from. I'm continuing to learn about my ancestors since applying for Italian citizenship.
The pandemic also helped me have more time to be thoughtful about my answers, time to dig up photos, ask my sisters questions.</p>

<p>In the end, I think the questions really made me feel good about my life, how I lived it, brought you both up in it and how we continue to learn, explore and ask questions.
Love you both so much. xoxox</p>

<p><em>Notes ahead of my talk to the Tufts CS and Entrepreneurship Communities</em></p>

<h2>What sparked you to get the entrepreneurship bug</h2>

<p>One possibility is that both of my parents were self-employed. My dad is a music producer and my mom was a photographer and then a real estate agent. Observing their ability to set their terms of work, and pursuing their work in ways that made it rewarding to them probably stuck with me.</p>

<p>In middle and high school, I'd sell gaming computers - order the components of Newegg and slap them together for friends at school. I also made websites and did neighborhood tech support. I think the ability to use technology as a means towards self-sufficiency was embedded at a young age. Towards the end of high school, I ran a summer camp for computer, video editing, Flash -yes flash- animation, and other fun things. That was the first time I developed a spreadsheet to model revenue, expenses like paying my co-teachers, and the snacks we'd get from our costco runs. That was super fun and since we were winging it, it didn't carry the baggage of a full-fledged "startup."</p>

<p>From that point on, I think there was a lot of pressure to start something. Observing all of the other students in my CS classes was exciting, but also daunting. It was exciting because I knew these folks would be my colleagues throughout my career. It was daunting because everyone else was so darn smart! I probably had a few dozen false start apps and ideas, usually getting sucked in to learning a new framework and forgetting to follow through on the concept or MVP.</p>

<p>My first job at Crashlytics made things click - how to create something of value to real users and grow it.</p>

<h2>Biggest lesson learned in your entrepreneurship journey?</h2>

<p>Big picture learning: Success is in the people and the execution, not the idea. I've been lucky to surround myself with some really talented folks, and the number of bad ideas outnumber the ones that have worked out 10-to-1. I'm not sure if this is just my luck, or if this is a universal truth, but it seems like you cross paths with folks you work with in your career often. I currently work with many people I've worked with at previous companies or know from Tufts. What does that mean? Work with empathy and care for your colleagues. You'll cross paths again. If you're a leader, lead with empathy. Push, but not too hard. Listen and change depending on what you hear.</p>

<h2>Tell the one unexpected encounter you have had in this journey?</h2>

<p>Any time something positive happens I am surprised. Shouldn't we be out of money? Is this large customer sure that they want to work with the new team versus the old school engineering firm that's been around for a geological age?</p>

<p>One thing that was unexpected was an invitation to the United Nations to testify about remote sensing and machine learning's potential to build resiliency in the face of climate change. Amadou and I dressed up and went to one the big chambers in the UN NYC headquarters that to me exist only in pictures. I received a lesson on how to properly thank the delegates for their questions and was shoved on stage to give a presentation and do Q&amp;A. That was pretty surreal.</p>

<h2>If you had to do it all over again, what would you have done differently?</h2>

<p>If you ask any mid-stride entrepreneur that question, they'd probably say "this" (referring to what they are doing at present) "... but sooner." We had some odd angles for our projects to start. We were deep in water markets, trying to build analytical systems to conserve water and move water to higher economic usage. It was complex. I learned a lot about that world, but wouldn't start with that again. It's the classic case of trial and error.</p>

<p>We were acquired in 2018 by Natel Energy. It's been a bizarrely perfect relationship, where we've been able to lean on their fundraising process and grow the team, and provide them with a diversified business model and a nice chunk of cash flow which balances out their core long-term hardware business. I think any person who's gone through an acquisition wonders "what if?" Not super productive, but certainly something that pops into my head from time to time.</p>

<h2>A reflection of how we work and grow as a fully remote team</h2>
<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/team-zoom.png" alt="The team on a Zoom meeting"/></p>

<p>There are plenty of lists of tools for remote teams, and some fantastic examples of documented processes (ex <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/">Gitlab</a>). I'm spending some time this weekend writing about how we work at Upstream Tech. The tools, yes, but also the fabric, connections and culture of our remote work.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since the write-up I did 2 years ago. We've gone from 3 employees to almost 20! With team growth like that, it's probably obvious that we had to adjust and refine our processes to enable collaboration, productivity, and well-being.</p>

<p>The content include excerpts from the documents we keep internally to track our processes and onboard new folks joining the team.</p>

<h2>Why Remote?</h2>

<p>A raised eyebrow is the most common response I get when I tell someone our team is “remote, yes entirely. There is no office. Spread across the whole country, 4 time zones.” The amplitude of the raised eyebrow is typically related to the industry that person inhabits. “How do you get anything done?” they usually ask.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/team-map.png" alt="Where we are located across NA"/> 
<em>This is where we are, as of 2020. With the majority in the Northeast.</em></p>

<p><em>But first, before we dive into the "what," allow me to outline the "why" of remote work. For us, the most important reasons are:</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>A broad talent pool, which when combined with other hiring practices and team culture can result in a more diverse team. This is the most exciting element of remote work for me. When you're not tied to a single city (or a subset of neighborhoods in a single city) you can tap into a wealth of perspectives, backgrounds, and identities that are wonderfully representative of what "tech" <em>could</em> be, if it were not so centralized in a few expensive cities.</li>
    <li>Flexibility to accommodate a variety of lifestyles and workstyles. Some folks prefer a midday break or exercise, others need to drop off/pick up children from daycare. And while this has always been feasible in the office - it's much easier to walk away from a computer monitor than it is to slink out of a bustling office.</li>
    <li>No commute; a lot of time is added to your day by this simple fact. You get to do with this newfound time what you please! What would be my commute is now a morning run through the Middlesex Fells.</li>
    <li>Fewer distractions and increased productivity. <a href="https://tedx.stanford.edu/lineup/nicholas-bloom">A Stanford study showed a "massive, massive improvement in performance — a 13% improvement in performance from people working at home."</a></li>
    <li>Transparency by default. Because collaboration and communication flows through *<em>written</em>* processes, it's possible to design systems that are transparent first. This eliminates hallway decisions and information silos, builds trust, and creates a more cohesive team.</li>
    <li>Retention of employees. We've had a quarter of our team encounter life events that have led them to move - and not just down the road, but to new states and cities. This massive change is usually job-ending, but for us it was barely noticeable aside from a changing video background and the potential changed timezone.</li>
    <li>Less expensive! The cost of commercial space is wild, especially in major metropolitan areas that have the talent pools necessary for collocated team growth.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Not bad! It's worth touching on potential "why nots":</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>One thing I've found especially challenging, through my own experiences and observing other companies, is organizing hybrid remote/in-person teams. When some team members are co-located and others are remote, it is very difficult to maintain transparency through communication and create inclusive decision-making processes. This can be avoided with rigorous design of meetings/decisions/processes and a condemnation for hallway brainstorming and decisions. But it can be tough, especially for those remote employees.</li>
    <li>Digital work begets digital collaboration. Many types of work do not jive with computer-centric collaboration. Certain hardware design, for instance. Physical design. These things require hands-on work from the whole team in a shared space.</li>
    <li>Fast growth. And not our 0 to 20 in 4 years growth (which admittedly felt VERY FAST), but I'm talking 0 to 100 in a year growth. Some companies like GitLab and InVision <em>have</em> managed this, so <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/studio-remote-design-team/">it isn't impossible</a> but it takes a lot of conscious design and a rigorous and thoughtful interviewing process.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are surely more benefits, and some trade-offs as well. Below, I'll highlight the details on how we organize and collaborate to achieve these benefits while minimizing the negative impact of the downsides (and I'd be foolish to claim there were none).</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Organization</h2>

<p>The composition of our team is two-thirds engineering and data science (we call it Product), and one-third business development and marketing (we call this Growth &amp; Partnerships / GP). The former, inhabiting the digital world by default, lends itself more to remote collaboration.</p>

<p>Although Product and GP roles respectively have different responsibilities, which result in different workflows, tools and processes, we try as much as possible to keep the majority of the tools and processes common across our organization. Why? Well, product development doesn't operate in a bubble. If anything, it is informed first and foremost by the conversations had with external parties: customers, collaborators, and partners. More often than not, we include folks from the product team on our calls with prospective and active relationships.</p>

<p>The second and more important reason is because we are one team! To lack cohesion in our day-to-day processes, especially as a remote team, will result in a lack of cohesion as a team. Dividing lines in process are akin to cracks in a team's foundation.</p>

<p>We organize ourselves into Product Teams, one for each active product effort. For example, as of February 2020, we have the following product teams:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lens</li>
    <li>HydroForecast</li>
    <li>AgTrends</li>
</ul>

<p>The teams vary in size and composition, depending on needs at any given time. Some folks share time across teams. Alden (our CTO) and Emily (our Engineering Manager) coordinate product team members to the different product teams on a weekly basis.</p>

<h2>Getting Together</h2>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/team-retreat-tree.png" alt="Team retreat, learing about trees"/> 
<em>Abby is our resident tree expert; in no small part because she graduated from the Yale School of Forestry. She teaches us about trees and our plants, both when we are together and when we are remote.</em></p>

<p>The most obvious trade-off that's pointed to by team in-person is that "sometimes you just have to get in a room and hash stuff out." We agree! And it isn't mutually exclusive with working remotely most of the time.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/team-retreat-2018-02.png" alt="Team retreat, Feb 2018"/>
<em>When we were a wee company, hiking in the Berkshires. February 2018.</em></p>

<p>Twice a year we gather as a team. Two folks lead the organization of the gathering: wrangling a date, picking a location, and soliciting topics for an agenda (although it is left partially unstructured so that we can hang out). Most of the time is spent cooking, outdoors, discussing goals, and brainstorming.</p>

<p>We select a location with the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Minimizes flights and maximizes our ability to carpool (because, carbon emissions...)</li>
    <li>Has plenty of space to cook, hangout and for everyone to have personal space (this has been a challenge in the past when we were trying to be very lean, but I think we've addressed it in our upcoming gathering)</li>
    <li>Is nearby natural areas for solid outdoor time</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/team-retreat-2018-07.png" alt="Team retreat, Jul 2018"/> 
<em>A bit bigger, with three of our favorite interns, in Somerville! July 2018.</em></p>

<p>We typically convene for 3-4 weekdays, which has been enough time to have downtime while still being possible for folks who have obligations back at home to join. And to be sensitive to such things, we don't require that folks come to every gathering; only that they do when it works well with their personal life schedule.</p>

<p>Topics and activities in the past have included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Brainstorming how an existing product can help a new market</li>
    <li>Reflecting on a program we did in the preceding 6 months (like our Accelerator program for NGOs)</li>
    <li>A book swap!</li>
    <li>"Power mapping" -- where do we see the product in 6 months to a year, what kind of impact do we want to have, who else do we need to engage to achieve those goals, who has the power/money to spark change in markets we want to work in - Lightning talk on "how to Kanban"</li>
    <li>Reflections on our processes and communication (meta!)</li>
</ul>

<h2>1-on-1s</h2>

<p>Getting together in-person is an important facet of building cohesion, trust, and empathy within a team. But for the time where a team is remote, regular 1-on-1 meetings help create space to chat about non-tactical work stuff, or perhaps not work stuff at all. Some opt to do them over the phone while going on a walk, others do it over video. Recent topics for me have ranged from talking about getting solar panels, to a great book I read recently, to lamenting how easy it is to procrastinate when taking an online self-paced course. Sometimes folks want to talk about high level work strategy, but most of the time it's like catching up with a friend.</p>

<p>I choose to do them weekly with the folks I work closest with and less frequently across the team.</p>

<h2>Cross-Org Tools</h2>

<p>Before I start talking about our workflows and processes, it's worth briefly outlining our tools:</p>

<h3><em>Google Drive and GSuite</em></h3>

<p>We use Google Drive for all of our internal and external documents. Internally, that includes documents for planning, brainstorms, call notes, pricing spreadsheets, etc. Externally: proposals, conference presentations, report deliverables, and more. We invested time to translate our design system to a set of professional document templates for anything external. We have a folder structure on a Team Drive that helps keep things organized.</p>

<p>We use Google Meet (part of GSuite) to do meetings, both internal and external. If the groups gets larger than about 10 people, we use Zoom.</p>

<h3><em>Slack</em></h3>

<p>Love it or hate it, it's good for discussing tactical stuff (<em>#upstream-product</em>), sharing resources like articles (<em>#upstream-articles</em>), notifying the team to feature releases (<em>#upstream-release-notes</em>), and generally sharing life stuff (<em>#upstream-watercooler</em>).</p>

<p><em>#upstream-watercooler</em> has been an awesome place to share stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere: book recommendations, questions about plants for our resident botany expert Abby, photos from a vacation, progress of knitting projects... you get the idea.</p>

<p>Slack has its issues, but with careful tuning of the notifications (Notifications → "Notify me about..." → "Direct messages, mentions &amp; keywords") and culling of sidebar madness ( Sidebar → Appearance → "Unreads and starred conversations") is imperative. Setting "Do Not Disturb" during focused blocks during the workday has been a technique that has worked well for our team to do deep dive writing, proposal preparation, and coding.</p>

<p>We also urge folks to first consider posting messages in public rooms if they have the potential to benefit other folks on the teams. For that reason, we created <em>#upstream-qs</em> and <em>#upstream-eng-qs</em> for general and engineering questions respectively. It has helped create a culture unafraid to ask questions. In my early jobs, I felt nervous to ask a question that made me look inexperienced. I make a point to ask all of my questions in these rooms as well, so that everyone, from Alden to our interns, feel comfortable asking anything.</p>

<p>We have one room worth noting called <em>#upstream-intentions</em>. Every morning, folks post “intentions” for the day. As the day goes on, we edit our intentions to show that something is done.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/team-slack.png" alt="Our #upstream-intentions room"/></p>

<p>It’s a very simple, low friction to-do list that drive self-accountability for the day, makes progress transparent, and helps call out cross-team dependencies first thing in the morning.</p>

<h3>GitLab</h3>

<p>As described on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitLab">GitLab</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>GitLab</em> is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git-repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features, using an open-source license, developed by GitLab Inc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Woah, that's quite a bit of functionality. When remote teams say "ah yes, we use GitLab" the thing I wonder is "how do you use it?" What are the processes in place to keep things moving?</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/team-gitlab.png" alt="Our GitLab board"/></p>

<p>Below is a combination of terminology and processes we use around GitLab's issue tracking system, which we use as the primary location of our current, imminent, and near future tasks across teams:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>An issue</em> is a unit of work that, when complete, results in some value from the customer’s perspective.</li>
    <li><em>A milestone</em> is a grouping of issues that are grouped together by a unit of customer value. For example, if a new feature requires us to first purchase data from a vendor, then integrate that data into the backend, then build a graph in the frontend, the three issues can be created and assigned to the best product teammate for the job, and then attributed to a common milestone that describes the issues’ interdependence and shared customer value.</li>
    <li>Each product team should have their own <em>product label</em>. A label is a tag that can be added to issues. It’s very helpful to have one per-product so that product teammates can quickly filter down to the necessary issues relevant to their work on a given week.</li>
    <li>GitLab <em>issues</em> are tracked in several <em>columns</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>A note about backlog issues</em>: We use the <a href="#1-3-6">1-3-6 document</a> as our way to track work that is longer term (six months in startup land is like 3 years in big company land). We try to keep GitLab issues <em>very fresh</em>, meaning issues that fall outside of the “this month” in the 1-3-6 document should likely <a href="https://codeburst.io/life-without-bug-tracking-925668ed6842">not exist</a> in GitLab.</p>

<h3>15Five</h3>

<p>Being a remote team makes it all the more important to regularly take the pulse of the team. Frankly, anxiety, uncertainty, excitement, and high-fiving isn't as recognizable over a screen as they are in person. We use 15Five to do two things: weekly pulse checks and biannual 360 review cycles.</p>

<p>The pulse-checks happen every Friday. We ask that each teammate takes 15 minutes to answer 5 questions. It also provides an opportunity to call out other teammates for being awesome. The virtual answer to an in-person high-five.</p>

<h2>Product Tools</h2>

<h3>Figma</h3>

<p>A small cohort of us use Figma to produce design, although we often opt to go from paper sketches straight to code. Figma has been a useful resource too when conducting market research: we create mocks of future functionality to gather feedback and spark conversation.</p>

<h3>Intercom</h3>

<p>We use intercom to interact with the customers on our website. We don't yet do anything particularly sophisticated outside of some automated emails, some lightweight help documentation, and triaging of inbound questions via a chat widget.</p>

<h2>Growth and Partnership Tools</h2>

<h3>Streak</h3>

<p><a href="https://streak.com">Stream</a> is a lightweight CRM that lives inside of Gmail to track pipelines and processes related to sales activities. It's fantastic because it doesn't require cumbersome BCC-ing to share emails related to the CRM entities - emails can be shared by default, and are properly associated with the CRM entities automatically based on domain name or email address. We use a Task feature for follow-ups (since they'd otherwise clog up our Kanban board in GitLab). We make sure all of these tasks have a deadline, because we all know how easy it is to kick a "follow up" can down the road. # Everyone's Responsibilities</p>

<p>We have three responsibilities we ask everyone on the team to adhere to</p>

<ul>
    <li>Keep customers happy and excited! By forming real relationships, building high quality products, by listening to customers, and by keeping our system stable.</li>
    <li>Keep your work visible; and keep tracking tools up-to-date.</li>
    <li>Self-organization and autonomy: if you don’t have something to work on, look for an open issue with your team’s label. If you’re not sure, ask the DRIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DRIs</h2>

<p>Each team has two <em>Directly Responsible Individuals</em>, one for Product and one for G&amp;P. The responsibility has overlaps in some regards, especially when it comes to translating customer feedback into product decisions. In other ways, we see a distinct separation in the responsibilities of the DRIs. The DRI role is not a "manager" role nor is it an "official" or permanent one. The DRI role is a leadership role. It is about pushing the project forward and making sure nothing falls through the cracks. Being a DRI doesn't mean I have to do all of the work, instead I should be resourceful to delegate and work with the right people on the team that will help me deliver the best result.</p>

<p>Shared responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Turning customer feedback into product decisions. This is the most shared responsibility, since the GP DRI is on the front-line of correspondence with the customer (and Product team members are often included in those communications/emails to bring technical perspective). One area we as a team haven't quite figured out is a great process for how customer feedback is stored and translated into product and feature decisions. We have a few processes we are experimenting with, but if anyone reading this has suggestions, send them our way!</li>
    <li>Maintaining the <a href="#1-3-6">1/3/6</a>.</li>
    <li>Fielding and managing business partnerships related to the business, with the Product DRI being responsible for any additional technical or product work due to the partnership, and the GP DRI responsible for all other aspects of the partnership.</li>
    <li>Facilitating feature releases for the product. We have a "feature development checklist" with recommended steps to follow when creating new releases of a product. This is important with machine learning models, especially with our forecasting products, as roll-out has to be managed in close communication with our customers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Planning and Coordination</h2>

<h3>Daily Sync</h3>

<p>One aspect of office life is that after the commute, you inhabit the same space as your coworkers. You chat while coffee trickles into the already-emptied carafe. Remote work doesn't afford the same sense of "showing up" and "seeing everyone arrive at their desks." We add a daily touchpoint of our own in the form of a daily, brief meeting at 11:30 am ET. We all hop into Zoom (we use zoom here because it allows the "gallery view," where you get to see everyone's face at once) and run through</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/team-daily-sync.gif" alt="Daily sync from early 2019"/>
<em>A rare gif of a morning sync from late 2018</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>announcements, such as vacations, things to celebrate, etc;</li>
    <li>weekly themes organized by product team, reiterating "what Friday looks like" and our progress;</li>
    <li>a "potpourri" section where we highlight any work that falls outside a product team's purvue.</li>
</ul>

<p>We rotate who leads the daily sync every week, running through the team alphabetically. Similarly, some product teams rotate who gives the day's update, and others' delivery is via the DRIs. Rotating who leads and gives updates is a great way to hear everyone on the team, and it gives a great sense of ownership over the process to the whole team.</p>

<h3>1-3-6</h3>

<p>One of the more concrete responsibilities of the DRIs is to maintain what we call the <em>1/3/6</em>, which highlights a product team’s plan for one month, three months, and six months in a decreasing level of detail. The decreasing level of detail allows us to see where we’re going without getting caught up in little planning details for something a few months away (which will probably need to change anyway).These documents serve as a center-point for team syncs, and work moving in the one month category is created as issues in the GitLab backlog.</p>

<p>Product teams have a meeting each week to plan their work for the coming week. Those meetings have nuances across the different teams, but here’s the agenda's gist:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Review the GitLab board, filtered with the product team's label. Go through each card and make sure it's in the right place, and make sure there are no cards missing for work in progress.</li>
    <li>Go to your team’s 1/3/6 month planning doc and look at what your current goal(s) are, what’s in our 1 month plan, adjusting and updating if necessary.</li>
    <li>Review upcoming customer deliverables/deadlines.</li>
    <li>Create next week’s weekly goals and update Weekly Themes doc.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Your Turn!</h1>

<p>There is a lot to consider when embarking to create and grow a remote team. It won't work for everyone. Some people find energy in physical nearness to their coworkers. Others may not have the autonomy necessary to thrive in a more independent work style. But for those teams that desire flexibility, and are inherently autonomous and asynchronous, I hope this document gives a window into the how and why of remote teams. Why remote work can be a powerful design for a team, especially a software or digital one, and some of the strategic and tactical steps we've taken to implement it successfully. At Upstream Tech, we are still learning a lot - and we will always make time at our in-person gatherings to discuss and adjust our processes and tools. But so far, we've been able use these concepts to scale our team's growth, build technologies for the environment, and counter climate change.</p>

<p>If you have a remote team and want to chat, or if you're looking to create a remote team within your organization, send me a message at <a href="https://twitter.com/marsh">@marsh</a>. I'd love to hear about what works well for your team or challenges you've encountered.</p>

<p>Remote work is a big part of what is to come for great teams!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 


<p>I inherited a garden. Actually, I took over a friend's apartment lease and the garden happened to come it. Alden and Anna, the bequeathers, had to make a short-notice move because of family member's failing health. Quinalt and I had been living in a large apartment building on the other side of Union Square - our last choice, and the result of the typical Boston everyone-moves-on-the-same-day scramble. We jumped at the chance to move into their lovely 2nd story apartment.</p>

<p>Alden and Anna had just built two modest plots, maybe 4x4 each. I remember Alden handing me sugar peas on a previous visit. Basil and tomatoes growing tall.</p>

<p>The downstairs neighbor, Ladawn, (it was a three-story, with one tenant on each floor) had two longer plots, maybe 3x12 in total. Brick stood at the perimeter to give it a few inches of rise. Every year, Ladawn's plants grew thick as small trees. Her cherry tomato plants would hang heavy, and her pole beans up their trellis would block the sun. She was also the weekly DJ at River Gods, one of the best bars in Cambridge. Her plants probably considered her a river god as well. She told me her secret once: to absolutely douse the plants every other day. To flood irrigate them. One day, about a year after Alden and Anna moved, she packed up an antique VW camper van and drove to Portland. River Gods coincidentally closed doors around the same time. So I inherited her garden too.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/garden_prescott.jpg" alt="Our garden at 20 Prescott in Somerville"/></p>

<p>I had two stellar seasons in these plots. In the first, I picked up where Ladawn left off, harvesting copious pole beans, tomatos, eggplants, herbs. The next, we planted a wider assortment, with the prized and celebrated crop being the Pumpkins.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/pumpkins.jpg" alt="3 pumpkins we grew, with an assortment of other veggies."/>
<em>Looking back at these pictures, I am astounded we grew these</em></p>

<p>I think the success of our first dance with this garden was in part due to the haphazard scattering of wildflower seeds by Alejandra. That and a rash of wild mint that flowered early. We'd regularly have dozens of bees busily pollinating the garden. Difficulty I've had with pumpkins in the past is in the polination, the flowers being as fragile and ephemeral as they are. But with an army of bees and other garden pals, it worked out.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/flowers.jpg" alt="Various flowers in our garden"/></p>

<p>This garden is sadly no more. When we moved out, the landlord weedwacked the whole area down to the bare soil - a nuissance, things growing like that. But I've since moved to a house in Medford. And while the yards are partly shaded by a beautiful, big American Walnut in the back and a Black Oak in the front, there are two slices of the yards that get tons of sunlight.</p>

<p>I went "whole hog" in the most vegetarian sense of the word. In these slices of sunlight, I built 4 raised beds with a combined volume of 8 cubic yards, and about 128 square ft of area (double what I had at this apartment).</p>

<p>The process of building and planning them was a perfect quarantine activity. I did a wild amount of research on wood types, natural wood treatments, soil types, Hügelkultur, seed suppliers, etc. I made it more difficult than in needed to be, but the process was as rewarding as the eventual results.</p>

<p>I decided to go with spruce pine. It's relatively "sustainable" - moreso because it's a fast growing regional softwood than because it has that pervasive stamp that I'm expected to take at face value. Cedar, which is the gold standard of rot-resistant raised bed material is also over $10/ft, which would have made this a very expensive endeavour indeed. Spruce pine, on the other limb, was $10 an 8'x4'x2" board. I opted for 24" tall beds because we live on a rock. And because it seemed like a challenge to get that much dirt back there to fill them. As simple as the design is, it was fun to sketch out a few configurations and realize the subtle changes impact on volume and area.</p>

<p>I found that raw linseed oil was one of the best and most readily available non-toxic treatments for the wood. Every week, I'd trot down to the tiny hardware store and buy all of the raw linseed oil on their shelves. They now know me as the linseed oil guy. Linseed oil also comes in a boiled version, which causes it to dry much faster, but these days has a number of chemical additives. So stick to raw, even if it takes many days or weeks to dry (depending on temp). I meticulously painted each board a few times before construction. The smell is fantastic - a woody, toasted sweetness. The closest thing I can think of is toasted seasame oil. I got it all over my clothes as I worked (and didn't care). The construction was simple, held together by 3-inch galvanized screws.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/beds_construction.png" alt="Two raised beds, partially constructed."/>
<em>I also raised the rain barrel so that it's just high enough to feed the beds</em></p>

<p>We use a compost company for weekly pickup - and they do bulk 50-50 compost/soil deliveries. So I did some math and ordered 7 cubic feet, knowing I'd do my best to fill the very bottom with fallen limbs, leaves and other woody debris. I laid down a tarp and the next day I stepped outside and the dirt was already there. I never saw the delivery occur, so as far as I know the delivery occurs by a visit from the licensed dirt wizard, who summons the requested cubic feet into place.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/dirt.jpg" alt="Roughly 7 cubic yards of dirt"/></p>

<p>Can't go to the gym because of COVID? Shovel dirt! I spent the next few weeks, hours per day, shoveling dirt. I got my climbing callouses back. My back and arms were sore! How could it possibly take so long, you ask? Well.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/where_the_dirt_has_to_go.jpg" alt="Steps up to the back yard"/> <em>Notice the pumpkins on the stairs. These were not grown by us, but next year they will be.</em></p>

<p>The dirt's trip to the back yard was no walk in the park, unless your park involves multiple steps and a incline you realize, suddenly, is <em>steep</em>. Multiple tactics were employed, including a wheelbarrow up haphazard wooden boards placed over stairs (hard), dual-wielded 5-gallon buckets (exhausting).</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I had heard about Hügelkultur, the german horticultural technique of mounding over decaying wood debris, from a colleague Abby. There had been recent windstorms in the area, so I collected as many fallen limbs as I could — scaring some of my neighbors by asking for their yard waste bags. Load followed load, and before I knew it the beds were filled. It was immensly satisfying to pour the last few shovelfuls into the beds.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/filling.jpg" alt="Two raised beds in the back yard, one filled, one partially filled with woody debris"/></p>

<p>The two front beds were on the aforementioned slope, so I opted to do a combination of digging into the hill to level the beds and to terrace them. I think they turned out great, although I'm a bit worried about accelerated rot because of how they are situated.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/front_beds.jpg" alt="Two raised beds in the front yard"/></p>

<p>With the beds completed, I now spend the winter planning what to grow, ordering seeds, and trying to start seedlings in my basement. My plan, loosely, is to grow the [[Three Sisters]] combo of corn, beans and squash in mounds in the back raised beds, interspersed with herbs, peppers and tomatoes, with a mixture of raddishes, peas, flowers, cabbage and oakra in the front. 98 days until Spring. 140 days until the last frost.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/how-we-work-1.png" alt="Obviously my desktop background…"/>
<em>Obviously my desktop background…</em></p>

<p>Ah yes, the unflappable entrepreneur: knowing from Day 1 that their business will last decades — nay a century! Not I.</p>

<p>If you told me, approximately two years ago, that Upstream would not only last two years, but continually gain momentum I’d respond “of course, of course!” but my stomach would ache with uncertainty. Alden and I were, after all, {an appeal for impact} (we still are — check back in a few decades).</p>

<p>Our thesis is this: It is possible for folks <em>in our line of work</em> to make a living working on something that also has positive social and environmental returns.</p>

<p>It’s sort of like the “triple bottom line” of investing (financial, social and environmental returns), but for day-to-day work. There are, of course professions where this is the default: teaching, social work, activism, journalism, etc. In our case we were looking specifically at technology’s role. And so far, so good! 2 years in, we’re working with some of the most incredible conservation groups, growing the team, and learning from some of the brightest folks in this line of work. We’ve also {upstream joins natel energy, joined Natel Energy}, which has opened many new doors and allowed us the stability to take greater risks.</p>

<p>It seemed appropriate at this milestone to reflect a bit, not just on how we started, but how we work — the minutia that make the day-to-day successful. Did I mention we are a remote team? Some of this may be obvious, all of it can be improved, but here is a glimpse into how we work:</p>

<h2>Morning intentions</h2>

<p>I mentioned this above with #upstream-intentions. Part of how we kick off our day is with a group video chat hitting a few important items for each team member:</p>

<ul>
    <li>How did yesterday go?</li>
    <li>What’s the plan for today?</li>
    <li>Do you need anyone’s help?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/how-we-work-2.png" alt="#upstream-intentions"/>
<em>#upstream-intentions</em></p>

<p>It’s a pretty basic framework that keeps morning meetings concise and thoughtful. There have been plenty of occasions where someone may be wrapping a big effort up and isn’t sure what the next best thing is to work on. In those cases we look at current and prospective partners and hash out what might be the highest value next work.</p>

<h2>Upstream IRL</h2>

<p>I’m a strong believer in the power and potential of remote work for the right team. However, there are always some things that are better done in person. Take cooking together, for example.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/how-we-work-8.jpeg" alt="Amadou and Alden cook up the world’s tastiest pasta from scratch."/>
Amadou and Alden cook up the world’s tastiest pasta from scratch.</p>

<p>Team bonding and long term planning are two such items for our team. Once a quarter, we pick a location and meet up in person. Sometimes it’s San Francisco at Natel Energy’s office. I’ve hosted in Somerville. Most recently, we rented an Airbnb in the Berkshires for a contemplative, hiking and cooking-filled week together. Business plans we had talked about for ages clicked in new ways. Technical scopes coalesced in turn. We left the week with a renewed energy (renewable energy?!), a stronger bond and a clear path forward with our work.</p>

<h2>1-on-1s</h2>

<p>We all do 1-on-1s with one another on a regular basis. We try not to reschedule or push back. They’re important! Informal phone calls while on walks or video chats. Simple, but possibly the most important time for communicating with your remote teammates.</p>

<h2>Show and tell</h2>

<p>I’ve worked at companies where there is a set “Show and Tell” slot on the calendar. It works great for large teams. Since we are small (and remote), we try to have a constant show and tell: do something neat over the weekend? Put it in slack! New screenshots of the prettier graphs you’re developing? ⌘V! Want to do a video walkthrough of a surprisingly accurate ML model? Drop a hangout link and show us. Constant sharing and celebration of work has made it just as exciting as running over to someone’s desk, and is far more inclusive.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/how-we-work-9.png" alt="A screenshot of Alden's first predictions of flow in an ungauged basin"/></p>

<p>It’s been an awesome few years, and I’m excited for many more to come. I’m sure most of how we work is par for the startup course these days, but I hope for some, it’s an interesting look into our daily routine.</p>

<p>And obligatorily: if the way we work sounds fun and our mission resonates, our team is <a href="https://upstream.tech/about">hiring</a>)! Send me a message at marshall@upstream.tech 🙋‍</p>

<p>Hello Upstream friends, customers and supporters!</p>

<p>We have big, happy news to share with you today. Upstream is joining <a href="https://www.natelenergy.com">Natel Energy</a>!</p>

<p>To those of you who know us well, this may come as a surprise. Heck — we weren’t even planning on raising money! But when we first met Gia and Abe Schneider in Boston earlier this year, it became immediately clear that we had the same mission “to create economic forces that drive environmental good.” To add to that, Natel’s board is an incredible group motivated by environmental conservation.</p>

<p><img src="https://mrshll.com/img/natel-hanger.png" alt="Natel’s massive hangar in Alameda"/>
<em>Natel’s massive hangar in Alameda</em></p>

<p>So what does this mean for our work?</p>

<ul>
    <li>We now have the support to grow Upstream’s existing products into an integrated dashboard for planning and monitoring freshwater project implementation.</li>
    <li>We are growing <a href="https://upstream.tech/about">our team</a> so that we can move faster and explore new applications of our technology. Interested in satellite imagery/machine learning/helping the environment? Get in touch!</li>
    <li>We are working closely with Natel’s development team (surprise!) to create repeatable, economically viable conservation finance projects by leveraging Upstream’s platform to scale Natel’s <a href="https://www.natelenergy.com/restoration-hydro/">Restoration Hydro</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We couldn’t be more excited about the coming years. Our goal in starting Upstream was modest: to apply ourselves to pressing issues with {an appeal for impact}. We never expected to be collaborating with the leaders in environmental conservation, clean energy and natural resource management, but here we are — and we are just getting started!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 


<p>As technologists, we have the privilege to exist in an era hungry for tweets, likes, cars that drive themselves, apps for exercise, sites to share other sites — and that gives us the opportunity to choose what we work on.</p>

<p>This is a simple appeal:</p>

<p>Make sure that what you spend 40+ hours a week working on — pouring energy, thoughtfulness and concern into — has impact.</p>

<p>We know that technology has already had a profound impact on social interaction, but instead of working to change our lifestyles, we need to work to change lives.</p>

<p>There are two paths: A mentor of mine once told me that in order to have the most impact, they would use this technology boom and amass wealth to then donate and redistribute. They may very well be right, and their success has allowed them to build a school and help whole communities.</p>

<p>The other path to impact is more direct. Find an intersection — the convergence of a cause and your skill sets — and pour everything in.</p>

<p>Don’t quit your job to be a “digital nomad.” Don’t start a company just to call yourself a founder. If you’re a technologist, you’re in the right place at the right time. <strong>Solve a real problem</strong>.</p>

<p>If you do choose the first route, consider recurring donations to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a>, the <a href="https://splcenter.org">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>, the <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org">Union of Concerned Scientists</a> and the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org">Natural Resources Defense Council</a> to name just a few.</p>

<p>If you want to be more direct, find an organization tackling the toughest climate problems. Look at <a href="http://greentownlabs.com/member-companies/">the members of Greentown Labs</a>, <a href="http://www.imagineh2o.org/portfolio">the previous classes of Imagine H2O</a> and non-profits like <a href="http://www.nature.org/">The Nature Conservancy</a> and <a href="http://www.tu.org/">Trout Unlimited</a>— they need technology to push forward. I strongly recommend Bret Victor’s webpage <a href="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/">What can a technologist do about climate change?</a> which in part inspired me to quit my job to {upstream tech, work on these problems}.</p>

<p>Consider the technological needs of education. <a href="http://www.bridgeinternationalacademies.com/company/about/">Bridge International Academies</a> uses incredible technology to bring high quality education to “families who live on less that \$2 USD per day.” <a href="https://www.panoramaed.com/">Panorama Education</a>, <a href="http://ellevationeducation.com/">Ellevation Education</a> and <a href="https://betterlesson.com/">Better Lesson</a> are all trying to help harness data to make our schools more effective for their students. Khan Academy has made an education accessible to anyone, and they’re <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers">hiring like crazy</a>. At the very least, volunteer at an <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us">Hour of Code</a> near you.</p>

See if you can help <a href="https://thelastmile.org/">The Last Mile</a>, an organization that “prepares incarcerated individuals for successful reentry through business and technology training.” The Electronic Frontier Foundation is <a href="https://www.eff.org/about/opportunities/jobs">looking for a new Front-End Web Developer</a>!</p>

<p>Whichever of these routes you take, the world will be a better place because of it.</p>
