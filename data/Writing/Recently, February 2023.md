Meadow is growing, work is A Lot, time is short, and the weather is weird. I think that sums up the time elapsed since [[Recently, January 2023]].

All my days now end and begin anew with Meadow's snores and smiles. Her glad recognition, in the valley of fatigue, is stronger than a cup of coffee. We've found a rhythm this past month and have started exploring more confidently; last week we went on our first hike together in [[the Middlesex Fells]] with our pals Sam, Aliza, and Jude. 

Coincidentally, I'm now on the board of the [Friends of the Fells](https://www.friendsofthefells.org/) which aims to protect and enhance the nature of the Fells.

Getting back to work after my too-brief parental leave has been intense. Between the company ramping up a number of start-of-year efforts, taking meetings while feeding Meadow, and pitching in more and more on a fundraising process for our parent company, the days leave me worn out. I love my work, the team I've built over the years, the impact we have - adding Meadow into the mix has made me realize that I have to, at least in this phase, let my creative projects slumber, and be especially disciplined to make time for recharging exercise in husk-state.

## Playing
Over the past few years, I've noticed that my preference of game has shifted from immersive, story-driven non-violent-ish single player games, to a seemingly disjoint group of multiplayer games. For a while I had trouble putting my finger on the common thread between the games I became infatuated with. First it was Sea of Thieves at the start of the pandemic, then it was Hell Let Loose, and most recently DayZ. 

Since I played my first game, immersion first and foremost was what made games enjoyable for me. Becoming part of the game-world. When I started playing multiplayer games in high school, I gravitated to ones where there was both immersion and emergent social interactions. My friend Henry, who I play often with, hit the nail on the head recently when he said that the sub-genre we found so intriguing could be called "multiplayer story engines."



## Elsewhere
Internet pal [Eli](https://eli.li/) shared [Mynah](https://git.sr.ht/~eli_oat/mynah), which helps you keep a digital garden/wiki from a directory of markdown files. I was smitten with the approach Eli took, which was to use a simple bash script that leveraged [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert from markdown to html. It sparked a whole host of ideas, including one I toyed with (but had to pause) to create an Instapaper-esque cli that takes a web URL and uses html > markdown > html as a questionable compression method to create a local saved copy of web articles.

I also came across the concept of ssh as an application protocol, a la [charm.sh](https://charm.sh/). That turned me on to [their Go libraries](https://charm.sh/libs/), to create rich and dynamic command line tools. I had some fun toying with their examples.
