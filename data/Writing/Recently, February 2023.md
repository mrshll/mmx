Meadow is growing, work is A Lot, time is short, and the weather is weird. I think that sums up the time elapsed since [[Recently, January 2023]].

All my days now end and begin anew with Meadow's snores and smiles. Her smile of recognition, in the valley of fatigue, is stronger than a cup of strong coffee. We've found a good rhythm this past month and have started exploring more confidently; last week we went on our first hike together in [[the Middlesex Fells]] with our pals Sam, Aliza, and Jude.

Getting back to work after my too-brief parental leave has been quite intense. Between the company ramping up a number of start-of-year efforts, taking meetings while taking a turn feeding Meadow, and pitch in more and more on a fundraising process for our parent company, the days leave me a dessicated husk. I love my work, the team I've built over the years, the impact we have - but adding Meadow into the mix has made me realize that I have to, at least in this phase, let my creative projects slumber, and be especially diligent to make time for exercise even in husk-state.
