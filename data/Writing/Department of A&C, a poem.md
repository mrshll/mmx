The tv screensaver<br/>
Powered by the Arts and Culture dept<br/>
of the world's third-largest corporation.

Displays 6 horses, wild? Grazing in the mountains of Colorado<br/>
Cuts to a concrete landscape - the Manhattan skyline as seen from queens<br/>
Cuts to an abstract fan, the color of a torii gate, artist attribution illegibly small.

The horses, free.<br/>
The city, control.<br/>
The shape, uncertain.

Dear Arts and Culture dept,<br/>
Is this an act of defiance?
