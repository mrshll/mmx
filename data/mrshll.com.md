Welcome to [[mmx]], the place I log ephemera, write, and jot down notes in my [[wiki]].

I started and run a climate and conservation company, [[Upstream Tech]] (see [Work and Pursuits of Toil](Work%20and%20Pursuits%20of%20Toil.md) for more). I also make [[music]], [[garden|grow living things]], and have a number of technical and non-technical [[Projects]], hobbies and interests.

I live in Medford, MA with Alejandra, our newborn Meadow, and pup Dax.

## Recently

Meadow :) and fundraising for work :( has kept me busy and I haven't had much time for projects nor writing.

I did recently update the [[Log]] and the [[Reading log]], and I wrote [[Work and Pursuits of Toil]] as a reflection on my professional life to date. 

## Active projects

- Closing a fundraising round for [[Upstream Tech]]
- Learning what it means to be a new parent
- Staring into Meadow's eyes
