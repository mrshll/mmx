Welcome to [[mmx]]. This started as a blank canvas for my digital identity, and has evolved into a place to log ephemera, share my projects, conduct fun experiments, and write.

I started and run a climate and conservation company, [[Upstream Tech]]. I also make [[music]], [[garden|grow living things]], and have a number of technical and non-technical [[Projects]], hobbies and interests.

I live in Medford, MA with Alejandra, our newborn Meadow, and pup Dax.
