A few pages in, I thought to myself "science fiction doesn't typically age
well, does it?" It's hard to imagine the experience of reading it in the year of its publication. And
in the many ways it is unfathomable in its foresight, it's "anti-woke" with
social forecasts and characters. I've seen Asimov fans say "It's not about
the characters!!1" and in a small way, maybe they're right? But a dozen pages
into _Foundation_, I realized there hadn't been a female character
introduced. A couple hundred(!) pages later, and it was still a boyz club
in space. Cool ideas indeed, but the story, and the characters, were forgettable at best.
