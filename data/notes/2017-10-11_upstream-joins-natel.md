Hello Upstream friends, customers and supporters!

We have big, happy news to share with you today. Upstream is joining {https://www.natelenergy.com|Natel Energy}!

To those of you who know us well, this may come as a surprise. Heck — we weren’t even planning on raising money! But when we first met Gia and Abe Schneider in Boston earlier this year, it became immediately clear that we had the same mission “to create economic forces that drive environmental good.” To add to that, Natel’s board is an incredible group motivated by environmental conservation.

So what does this mean for our work?

- We now have the support to grow Upstream’s existing products into an integrated dashboard for planning and monitoring freshwater project implementation.
- We are growing {https://upstream.tech/about/team|our team} so that we can move faster and explore new applications of our technology. Interested in satellite imagery/machine learning/helping the environment? Get in touch!
- We are working closely with Natel’s development team (surprise!) to create repeatable, economically viable conservation finance projects by leveraging Upstream’s platform to scale Natel’s {https://www.natelenergy.com/restoration-hydro/|Restoration Hydro}.

We couldn’t be more excited about the coming years. Our goal in starting Upstream was modest: to apply ourselves to pressing issues with {an appeal for impact}. We never expected to be collaborating with the leaders in environmental conservation, clean energy and natural resource management, but here we are — and we are just getting started!
