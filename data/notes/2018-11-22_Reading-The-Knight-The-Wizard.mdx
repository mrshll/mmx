This series was recommended to me by one of my best pals, Quinault, so I had
to pick it up. There is something so bizarre about these books, something
that made them foggy -- incoherent at times -- and made me half-expect for
the protagonist to wake up with a gasp for air realizing that the whole
fantasy plot was a dream. We follow a kid who wanders away from his brother
and into a messy fantasy world where he lives the rest of his life becoming a
knight. It twists cliché into creativity -- more creative than any fantasy
book I've read recently. When I finished, I was completely perplexed. There's
constant subtext and references, making it challenging, rewarding, and likely
for 50% of readers to absolutely hate it.
