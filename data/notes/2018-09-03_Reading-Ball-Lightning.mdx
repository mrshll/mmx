Following a deep obsession with Liu's _Remberance of Earth's Past_ trilogy, I
picked up a standalone novel of his about the quirky science of harnessing
the power of ball lightning. As always with his books, there are fascinating
forward-thinking ideas, and in this case they are far more terrestrially
focused than the trilogy. There is a bit more lost in translation, I think,
and everything is so military-focused I found it exhausting. That could be a
reflection of the realities in China (and heck, in the US too, who am I
kidding). All in all, it was not quite as compelling as the triology, but
certainly a fun and interesting read.

At the very end was context-setting that I wish had been at the beginning:

> Those books set the foundation for my concept of science fiction and were a
> catalyst for the later Three-Body trilogy; however, their influence did not
> extend to Ball Lightning. When I wrote this novel in 2003, I already had a
> mostly complete Three-Body series, but I felt that Chinese readers would
> respond more readily to a novel like Ball Lightning at that time. China’s
> science fiction was born more than a century ago, at the close of the Qing
> Dynasty, but for most of its history it developed in relative isolation, and
> for a long period was entirely cut off from modern western science fiction.
> The field’s independent development gave the work of that period a distinct
> style, a difference that is clearly evident from a comparison of Ball
> Lightning and the Three-Body series. Chinese science fiction during that
> closed-off period was dominated by the invention story, a form that was
> preoccupied with the description of a futuristic technological device and
> speculation on its immediate positive effects, but which barely touched the
> invention’s deeper social implications, much less the tremendous ways such
> technology would transform society. And so it is with Ball Lightning: the
> emergence of such a powerful technological force is bound to have huge,
> far-reaching effects on human society—in politics, economics, and even in
> culture. The book addresses none of this. But this similarity to early-period
> Chinese science fiction is only skin-deep; at its heart, this is not a
> Chinese-style story. The ball lightning described in the book may resemble
> that sort of futuristic device, but the flights of fancy it gives rise to are
> nowhere to be found in the science fiction of that period. And while the book
> is set in a China that is altogether real, those little balls of lightning
> seem like they’re trying to transcend that reality, like how a man’s tie,
> within the confines of its narrow dimensions, has the freedom to indulge in a
> riot of colors and patterns unbounded by the rigid formula of a business
> suit. In a way, Ball Lightning is a prequel to the Three-Body series, since
> it concludes with the first appearance of the aliens that would eventually
> threaten humanity and features a version of Ding Yi, who also appears in
> later books.
