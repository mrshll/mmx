As it likely has been throughout the past decades, 1984 is frequently referenced as the "told you so" of dystopic novels. I expected the likeness with current events to be limited to "society is crushed and the ruling class are evil," but the parallels of our protagonist's employment at the Ministry of Truth with today's controversy surrounding social media, censorship, and "fake news" (yikes I can't beleive I typed that) is stark and uncomfortable.

Of the science fiction from decades past that I've read recently, this one has aged the best. And that's unfortunate.

> You had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinised.

Okay Google! Define "scrutinised." Hey Alexa! "Turn on the living room lights."

> At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun: today, to believe that the past is unalterable.
