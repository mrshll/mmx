by Robert Louis Stevenson

> Seaward ho! Hange the treasure! It's the glory of the sea that has turned my head.

There are many a classic I have not yet laid me eyes upon. Moby Dick and (up until now) Treasure Island among them. The writing style and dialog were amazing - something about the phrasing and lexicon lodged itself in my head, and I found myself phrasing things most pirately to my colleagues and partner.

> Sir, with no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth.
