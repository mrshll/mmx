by George Saunders and Various Authors

Saunders makes the art of fiction writing approachable and welcoming through the lens of Russia's greats. It drew me in twofold, first making writing fiction feel more within reach through exercise and experiment, and second introducing me to Chekhov, Turgnenv, Tolstoy and Gogol - with analyses from George to get more out of each story.
