**Local-first** (from [Peter van Hardenberg - Why Canâ€™t We Make Simple Software?](https://vimeo.com/780013486)) : Runs on your computer, but collaborates with others.

- One approach: build in the browser, store everything locally (i.e. IndexDB)
- Collaboration is too important to move away from.
- [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) has a number of examples of local application research
- [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) is a library of data structures for building collaborative applications in JavaScript.
