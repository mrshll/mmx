## Notes from [The role of the CEO: managing yourself â€“ High Growth Handbook](https://growth.eladgil.com/book/the-role-of-the-ceo/role-of-the-ceo-managing-yourself/)

Key components of personal time management include:

-   Delegation.
-   Auditing your calendar regularly.
-   Saying no more often.
-   Realizing your old way of operating will no longer work.
-   Finding time for the things you care about in life.

> The very best executives tend to be a combination of a router (i.e., they send items on to other people for execution and end meetings with few to no action items for themselves), a strategist, and a problem solver (i.e., someone who can identify when the team is off track and dive in to help).

> Only fundraise when you are ready to do so and it supports a set of objectives for your company.

> Some product-centric founders end up having to spend endless hours on managing people, sitting in meetings discussing sales compensation plans, sales pipelines, marketing plans, HR issues, and other items that bore them to tears. Mark Zuckerberg famously delegated big swaths of Facebook to Sheryl Sandberg in order to free up more time to focus on product and strategy.
