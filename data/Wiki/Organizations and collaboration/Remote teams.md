## Why remote

  - It's the future of work
  - Obvious things:
    - No rent!
    - Huge talent pool for hiring
  - Can change relationship with work in major ways. If you're thoughtful in the boundaries, guidelines and processes set up - the change can be a huge positive for autonomous, self-accountable people. If run like an in-person team, it can be always-on, anxiety-inducing.
    - Changing schedules (like Best Buy work experiment)
    
## Remote challenges

  - Requires dedicated focus to build empathy across team
  - Work as social outlet doesn't come as naturally for remote teams
  - Need to iterate on process, especially at growth milestones
  - Communication, if treated like an in-person company, can be all-consuming and painful.
+ A shift in communication
  - Discussions in public, summary
  - Thoughtful organization of conversations
  - Discipline
