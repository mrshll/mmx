The Fells is a couple thousand acre reservation in Malden, Medford, Melrose, Stoneham and Winchester, MA. It is one of the country's first conservation reservations, first managed as a state park.

There may be a more broadly accepted dissection of the regions of the Fells, but I think of them in 5 parts:
+ *The West Fells*, where Winchester's reservoirs are located and more importantly the Skyline Trail (and many others)
+ *The East Fells*, with the Fells Reservoir and the incredible Rock Circuit Trail
+ *The Center Fells*, including Medford's Wright's Pond up to Spot Pond, separated from the East and West by Fellsway West and Woodland Rd
+ *The Northeast Fells*, where Virginia Woods is located, north of the Spot Pond Brook.
+ *The Southwest Fells*, abutting Medford Highschool, separated from the West Fells by S Border Rd.
