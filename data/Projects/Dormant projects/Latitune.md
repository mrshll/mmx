## Drop songs in places for others to pick up
Latitune was a app created at the end of college with [Ben Weitzman](https://www.benweitzman.com/) (who is a brilliant software developer). The app allowed users to "drop" songs at locations, and to see and listen to songs that were within a certain radius. We created a prototype, but with school wrapping up it never fully came to fruition. We had planned a feature where as you walked, the app would accumulate songs passed by into a playlist.
