[Source code](https://github.com/mrshll/mmx/blob/main/src/mmxup.go)

mmxup entries have names, hosts, titles, and bodies. They optionally have dates. An entry can optionally  be an index
(examples: {wiki} and {mrshll.com}). The reference graph enables inbound and outbound relationships to be rendered.

The markup resembles markdown with a few key differences inspired by {https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/indental.html} (for metadata) and {https://thomasorus.com/kaku.html} (for markup syntax), with unique design decisions based on my preferences.
