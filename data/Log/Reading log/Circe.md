Ever since I dove into Neil Gaiman's _Sandman_ in highschool, I have been an absolute sucker for retelling of mythology. This book is no exception. Recommended to me by both my mom and brother, the pacing, character development, and atmosphere are perfect. Her prose is beautiful without feeling like a classic from literature class. I highlighted a number of passages that stood out in this way. For example:

> But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.

and

> Some stories he told me by daylight. Others came only when the fire was burnt out, and there was no one to know his face but the shadows.
