by Trevor Noah

This book was recommended to me by my teammate Eliza, specifically to listen to as an audiobook. Upon starting it up, I immediately realized why. Read by the author (host of The Daily Show) gave the coming of age story a quality I haven't experienced in an audiobook before. It was something closer to a podcast like This American Life than your typical non-descript British accented delivery.

Noah's story ultimately was of his relationship with his mother. I listened to it end-to-end on a drive from Boston to Nashville coincidentally to visit my mother. Somewhere near Roanoke, the story's ending brought me to tears, and gave me a newfound appreciation for motherhood.
