Went down a TodePond rabbit hole over a cup of tea (i.e. this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/L2U_Sd1qMJ4?si=Pz51u4cIf5HwwMk-&t=2576">live talk</a>). Their energy and enthusiasm about spatial programming -- and their storytelling bringing us along the discovery journey -- was incredible. It was one of those mind expanding nights. I've been dealing in "spatial data" from the meteorology, satellite, and geospatial perspective for some time, but this concept of rule-based computation (like, say <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html">Orca</a>), explained in this way, had me scribbling down sparks of thoughts, not yet ideas, about how they could relate to forecasting dynamical systems and defining environments.

Thank you, Lu!
