Welcome to ![]([mmx]). This started as a blank canvas for my digital identity, and has evolved into a place to log ephemera, share my projects, conduct fun experiments, and write.

I started and run a climate and conservation company, [[Upstream Tech]]. I also make ![[[garden|grow living things]([music]])], and have a number of technical and non-technical ![]([Projects]), hobbies and interests.

This site is my place to ![keep [[Wiki|notes]([writing|write]])], share ![and write about my [[projects]([log|ephemera]])].

I live in Medford, MA with Alejandra, our newborn Meadow, and dog Dax in our home Valetop.
